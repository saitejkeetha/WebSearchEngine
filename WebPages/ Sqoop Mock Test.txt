Mock Test I Mock Test II Mock Test III Mock Test IV Sqoop Mock Test I Q 1 - Which of the following is used by sqoop to establish a connection with enterprise data warehouses? A - RDBMS driver B - JDBC Driver C - IDBC Driver D - SQL Driver Answer : B Explanation The JDBC driver is a java program which has been traditionally providing data base connectivity to a variety of databases. Show Answer Q 2 - Besides the JDBC driver, sqoop also needs which of the following to connect to remote databases? A - Putty B - SSH C - Conenctor D - sqoop client Answer : C Explanation Sqoop Needs both JDBC driver and Database connector which is required to import data. Show Answer Q 3 - To run sqoop from multiple nodes, it has to be installed in A - Any one of the in the local filesystem. B - each of the node where it is supposed to run C - Only on a pair of nodes of the cluster D - Need not be installed. Answer : A Explanation On installing in one node it, automatically gets replicated to other nodes in the cluster. Show Answer Q 4 - By default the records from databases imported to HDFS by sqoop are A - Tab separated B - Concatenated columns C - space separated D - comma separated Answer : D Explanation The default record separator is comm. Show Answer Q 5 - To import data to Hadoop cluster from relational database sqoop create a mapreduce job. In this job A - All the data is transferred in one go. B - each mapper transfers a slice of Table's data C - Each mapper transfers tables' data along with table's metadata (name of the columns etc) D - Only the schema of relational table is validated without fetching data Answer : B Explanation A Mapreduce job executes multiple mappers and each mapper retrieves a slice of Table's data. Show Answer Q 6 - The parameter in sqoop which specifies the output directories when importing data is A - --output-path B - --target-path C - --output-dir D - --target-dir Answer : D Explanation The --target-dir and --warehouse-dir are the two parameters used for specifying the path where import will be done. Show Answer Q 7 - If there is already a target directory with the same name as the table being imported then A - The directory gets deleted and recreated. B - The sqoop job fails C - Another directory under the existing directory gets created. D - The existing directory gets renamed Answer : B Explanation To prevent accidental deletion of data the job fails. Show Answer Q 8 - To prevent the password from being mentioned in the sqoop import clause we can use the additional parameters A - -p B - --password-file C - both of these D - cannot be prevented Answer : C Explanation The -P option asks for password from standard input without echoing and --password-file option reads the password value stored in some other file. Show Answer Q 9 - What are the two binary file formats supported by sqoop? A - Avro & SequenceFile B - Rcfile and SequenceFile C - ORC file and RC file D - Avro and RC file Answer : A Explanation These are the two binary file formats supported by Sqoop. Show Answer Q 10 - While SequenceFile stores each record as key-value pair, the avro system stored records as A - Simple text B - chained lists C - Linked lists D - schema and data Answer : D Explanation Sqoop generates the schema automatically when reading the data and stores the schema details along with the data in each Avro file generated. Show Answer Q 11 - The compression mechanism used by sqoop is A - built in sqoop B - delegated to Hadoop C - supplied as a java plugin to sqoop D - Needs to be installed in the OS runnign sqoop Answer : B Explanation Sqoop does not have any inbuilt code to carry out file compression. It relies on Hadoop's compression settings. Show Answer Q 12 - For some databases sqoop can to faster data transefr by using the parameter A - --bulkload B - --fastload C - --dump D - --direct Answer : D Explanation The direct mode delegates the data transferring capabilities to the native untilities provided by the database. Show Answer Q 13 - The data type mapping between the database column and sqoop column can be overridden by using the parameter A - --override-column-type B - --map-column-type C - --override-column-java D - --map-column-java Answer : D Explanation As sqoop uses the Java Data types internally, the mapping of the data types has to be done with Java Data Types. Show Answer Q 14 - What does the num-mappers parameter serves? A - force sqoop to use only one map task B - set the number of map tasks sqoop can use C - store the data imported by each map tasks in a separate file D - Fetch each row form the table using a new map task Answer : B Explanation The default number of map task ssqoop uses is 4. This can be altered using num-mappers parameter. Show Answer Q 15 - What is the default value used by sqoop when it encounters a missing value while importing form CSV file. A - NULL B - null C - space character D - No values Answer : B Explanation unlike databases there is no NULL values in CSV files. Those are handled by sqoop by using null string. Show Answer Q 16 - What option can be used to import the entire database from a relational system using sqoop? A - --import-all-db B - --import-all-tables C - --import-all D - --import Answer : C Explanation The --import-all-tables is used to import all the tables from the database. The tables structure as well as data is imported one by one through this command. Show Answer Q 17 - what option can bne used to import only some of the table from a database while using the --import-all-tables parameter? A - --skip-tables B - --without-tables C - --forgo-tables D - --exclude-tables Answer : D Explanation You can mention the tables names along with the --exclude-table clause to skip a given number of tables while importing an entire database. Show Answer Q 18 - Sqoop supports A - full import of tables B - partial import of data from tables C - Both full and partial data import D - Import both the table and its partitions Answer : C Explanation You can do both full and partial data import from tables but not a subset of columns from a table. Show Answer Q 19 - What are the two different incremental modes of importing data into sqoop? A - merge and add B - append and modified C - merge and lastmodified D - append and lastmodified Answer : D Explanation The --incremental parameter is used to fetch only the new data (data which does not already exist in hadoop) . It is done as an append if there are columns specified to be checked for new data. it cal also use the last modified parameter which will use the last_updated_date column from the existing table to identify the new row. Show Answer Q 20 - What does the --last-value parameter in sqoop incremental import signify? A - What is the number of rows sucessfully imported in append type import B - what is the date value to be used to select the rows for import in the last_update_date type import C - Both of the above D - The count of the number of rows that were succesful in the current import. Answer : C Explanation Sqoop uses the --last-value parameter in both the append mode and the last_update_date mode to import the incremental data form source. Show Answer Q 21 - The --options-file parameter is used to A - save the import log B - specify the name of the data files to be created after import C - store all the sqoop variables D - store the parameters and their values in a file to be used by various sqoop commands. Answer : D Explanation The command line options (the name and value of the parameters) that do not change from time to time can be saved into a file and used again and again. This is called an options file. Show Answer Q 22 - while specifying the connect string in the sqoop import command, for a Hadoop cluster, if we specify localhost in place of a server address(hostname or IP address) in the URI, then A - The import job will connect to local databases B - Each node may connect to different databases C - the import job may succeed D - All of the above Answer : D Explanation Specifying localhost does not invalidate the command as some local database may be running and the node will be able to connect. So each node will connect to different database if they are available. Show Answer Q 23 - What is the disadvantage of storing password in the metastore as compared to storing in a password file? A - it is easily accessible B - it may get deleted accidentally C - It cannot be updated D - it is unencrypted Answer : D Explanation The password file can be encrypted and prevented from reading by proper permissions. But metastore is unencrypted and cannot be prevented from reading. Show Answer Q 24 - What is the advantage of storing password in a metastore as compared to storing in password in a file? A - It can be run by any user with valid access to sqoop environment B - The password in metastore can be updated while that in password file cannot be C - The password file can be encrypted while the metastore cannot be encrypted D - User intervention is required in password file but not in metastore. Answer : A Explanation The main advantage of using metastore is it can be used by any user having access to the environment without knowing the password. Show Answer Q 25 - The argument in a saved sqoop job can be altered at run time by using the option A - --alter B - --newval C - --exec D - --changeparam Answer : C Explanation For a saved job named 'job1' the --table parameter can be altered at run time by using the command below. sqoop job --exec job1 -- --table-newtable.
