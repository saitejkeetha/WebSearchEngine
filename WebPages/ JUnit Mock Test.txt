Answer : C Explanation JUnit tests can be organized into test suites containing test cases and even other test suites. JUnit shows test progress in a bar that is green if test is going fine and it turns red when a test fails in eclipse. Show Answer Q 10 - Which of the following is correct about a Unit Test Case? A - A Unit Test Case is a part of code which ensures that the another part of code (method) works as expected. B - A formal written unit test case is characterized by a known input and by an expected output, which is worked out before the test is executed. C - The known input should test a precondition and the expected output should test a postcondition. D - All of the above. Answer : D Explanation All of the above options are correct. Show Answer Q 11 - Which of the following is correct about a Unit Test Case? A - There must be at least two unit test cases for each requirement: one positive test and one negative test. B - If a requirement has sub-requirements, each sub-requirement must have at least two test cases as positive and negative. C - Both of the above. D - None of the above. Answer : C Explanation There must be at least two unit test cases for each requirement: one positive test and one negative test. If a requirement has sub-requirements, each sub-requirement must have at least two test cases as positive and negative. Show Answer Q 12 - When should Unit Tests be written in Development Cycle?
