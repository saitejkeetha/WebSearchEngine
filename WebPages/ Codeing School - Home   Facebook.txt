Hi, I am BTech final Year student (CS), will pass out this year. I write code since 3years, almost each and every day. I did many projects on ML, and Web Dev(Django, React js, Node Js), and I did an internship on React Native(2months). Currently, I am working on Django and React (busy to create a blog). Today I start the social media trend called #100daysofcode. So, technically today is my 4th day. Yes, I start this and I will post every day what... I have done today in #100daysofcode. ---------------------------------------- What I Did Today: Today I add Bootstrap to my Front End off my blog app, and remove the ant design (because this is chinese product ðŸ¤£). And add the Tiny MCE post Editor. --------------------------------------------- GitHub: https://github.com/isubhamsr . Website: https://www.codeingschool.com/ .
