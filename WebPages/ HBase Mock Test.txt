Show Answer Q 2 - Columns in Hbase are organized to A - Column Group B - Column families C - Column list D - Column base Answer : B Explanation In Hbase columns are organized to column families. Show Answer Q 3 - Hbase is what type of database? A - Schema-rigid B - Schema-flexi C - Schema-less D - Not a database Answer : C Explanation Hbase is a schema less database as it stores data in column families which does not have a fixed or rigid structure to follow. Show Answer Q 4 - The Value that is unique across all the rows in Hbase table is A - Rownum B - RowIndex C - RowID D - RowKey Answer : D Explanation Rowkey is the value which is the unique values across all the rows. Show Answer Q 5 - To locate a piece of data Hbase uses coordinates. A coordinate is made-up of A - rowId, table name, block address B - rowid, table name, column name C - rowkey, table name, column name D - rowkey, table name, block address Answer : C Explanation Rowkey ,table name and column name create a unique combination which can identify a piece of data in Hbase. Show Answer Q 6 - Which of the following is not one of the primitive commands to interact with Hbase A - Drop B - Get C - Put D - Scan Answer : A Explanation The five primitive commands for interacting with Hbase are Get, put, Delete, Scan and Increment. Show Answer Q 7 - There are 2 programs which confirm a write into Hbase. One is write-ahead log(WAL) and the other one is A - Mem confirm log B - Write complete log C - log store D - Memstore Answer : D Explanation The write access log and Memstore confirm the writing of a Hbase value. Show Answer Q 8 - What is the number of MemStore per column family A - 1 B - 2 C - Equal to as many columns in the column family D - Equal to as many column families in the table. Answer : A Explanation There is only one Memstore per column family Show Answer Q 9 - The number of HF files, one column family in Habse can have is A - Equal to number of columns in the column family B - More than one C - Only one D - Only tow Answer : B Explanation Onr column family can have multiple HF files associated with it. Show Answer Q 10 - A single HF file can be associated with A - All the column families in a table B - Only one column family C - Only column families containing character data D - Column families form multiple tables. Answer : B Explanation A single HF file can be associated with only one column family. Show Answer Q 11 - While reading data from Hbase the command used to get only a specific column instead of all the columns in a column family is A - Onecolumn B - Addcolumn C - FilterCOlumn D - Dropcolumns Answer : A Explanation The addcolumn() command displays result for specific column given as a input to this command rather than all the columns in a table, which is the default behavior. Show Answer Q 12 - The addFamily() command is used for A - Displaying all columns of a specific column family B - Add new column family to the table C - Add a group of column families to a table D - Add a column to a column family. Answer : A Explanation The addFamily() command displays all the columns of a specific column family. Show Answer Q 13 - While reading from Hbase the sequence in which the read happens is A - MemCache,Blockcache,HFile B - Blockcache,HFile,Memcache C - MemCache,HFile,Blockcache D - HFile,Memcache,Blockcache Answer : A Explanation The order is first read the Memcache, then the Blockcache and finally the HFile. Show Answer Q 14 - A record deleted in Hbase is not removed from Hbase immediately. Instead it is written to another file and marked as Delete. Such a file is Known as A - DFile B - Tombfile C - Tombstone D - Earmark Answer : C Explanation The deleted records are stored in file is known as Tombstone.

This process is known as A - Compaction B - Retraction C - Consolidation D - Separation Answer : A Explanation The process of merging tombstone files and creating a new HFile only containing the records not marked for delete is known as compaction. Show Answer Q 16 - When a compaction operates over all HFiles in a column family in a given region, it is called A - Major compaction B - Family compaction C - Final compaction D - Full Compaction Answer : A Explanation IN a Major compaction all the HFIles of a column family for a given region are acted upon. Show Answer Q 17 - At the end of a major compaction the number of HFiles of a Hbase table is A - Equal to number of column families B - One HFile C - Half of the number of column families of a region D - Double the number of column families of a region Answer : A Explanation At the end of major compaction one column family gets one HFile. Show Answer Q 18 - Hbase creates a new version of a record during A - Creation of a record B - Modification of a record C - Deletion of a record D - All the above Answer : D Explanation All the three events of creating,modifying and Deleting a record create a new version of the record inHbase. Show Answer Q 19 - Each version of data within a cell adds a versioning information through a A - VersionNo B - KeyValue C - KeyNo D - VersionValue Answer : B Explanation Each version of data within a cell contributes one KeyValue instance to the Result. Show Answer Q 20 - The verison information of a record in a KeyValue instance is inspected using the method A - getVersion() B - getTimestamp() C - getTime() D - getVersioninfo() Answer : B Explanation The getTimestamp() method is used to inspect the specific verison associated with a KeyValue Instance. Show Answer Q 21 - The method which deletes a specific version within a cell is A - Deletecolumns() B - Deletecolumn() C - Deleteversionno() D - Deletespecific() Answer : B Explanation The deletecolumn() deletes a specific version but deletecolumns() deletes all the versions in a cell prior to the specified version.
