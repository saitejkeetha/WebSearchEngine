Show Answer Q 2 - What is the output of the following program?  #include<stdio.h> void swap(int m, int n) { int x = m; m = n; n = x; } main() { int x=5, y=3; swap(x,y); printf("%d %d", x, y); } A - 3 5 B - 5 3 C - 5 5 D - Compile error Answer : B Explanation 5 3, call by value mechanism canâ€™t alter actual arguments.  #include <stdio.h> void swap(int m, int n) { int x = m; m = n; n = x; } main() { int x=5, y=3; swap(x,y); printf("%d %d", x, y); } Show Answer Q 3 - Identify the incorrect file opening mode from the following. A - r B - w C - x D - a Answer : C Explanation x, there is no such mode called â€œxâ€?. Show Answer Q 4 - Choose the correct option in respect to the following program.  #include<stdio.h> void f(int const i) { i=5; } main() { int x = 10; f(x); } I - Error in the statement â€˜void f(int const i)â€™ II - Error in the statement i=5. A - Statements I & II are true B - Statements I & II are false. C - Statement I is true D - Statement II is true. Answer : D Explanation We cannot modify a constant as in statement i=5. Show Answer Q 5 - What is the output of the following program?  #include<stdio.h> main() { char s[20] = "Hello\0Hi"; printf("%d %d", strlen(s), sizeof(s)); } A - 5 9 B - 7 20 C - 5 20 D - 8 20 Answer : C Explanation Length of the string is count of character upto â€˜\0â€™. sizeof â€“ reports the size of the array. Show Answer Q 6 - Turbo C in 16 bit DOS OS, the correct range of â€œlong doubleâ€? is, A - 3.4E-4932Â to 3.4E+4932 B - 3.4E-4932Â to 1.1E+4932 C - 4.1E-4932Â to 5.1E+4932 D - 0.7E-4932Â to 1.8E+4932 Answer : B Explanation Explanation: The integral and precession value varies depending upon the number of bytes designated for a particular data type. Show Answer Q 7 - The correct order of mathematical operators in mathematics and computer programming, A - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division B - Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction C - Multiplication, Addition, Division, Subtraction D - Mathematical operators can be done in any order Answer : B Explanation It is BODMAS. Show Answer Q 8 - In DOS, how many bytes exist forÂ near, farÂ andÂ hugeÂ pointers? A - Near: 2, far: 4, huge: 7 B - near: 4, far: 2, huge: 8 C - near: 2, far: 4, huge: 4 D - near: 4, far: 0, huge: 0 Answer : C Explanation In DOS, numbers of byte exist for near pointer = 2,Â far pointer = 4Â andÂ huge pointer = 4. In Windows and Linux, numbers of byte exist for near pointer = 4,Â far pointer = 4Â andÂ huge pointer = 4. Show Answer Q 9 - What will be the output of the following program?  #include<stdio.h> int main() { const int i = 0; printf("%d\n", i++); return 0; } A - 100 B - Infinity C - 0 D - Return error Answer : D Explanation It is because ++needs a value and aÂ constÂ variable canâ€™t be modified.  #include<stdio.h> int main() { const int i = 0; printf("%d\n", i++); return 0; } Show Answer Q 10 - In the given below code, what will be the value of a variable x?  #include<stdio.h> int main() { int y = 100; const int x = y; printf("%d\n", x); return 0; } A - 100 B - 0 C - Print x D - Return Error Answer : A Explanation Although, integer y = 100; and constant integer x is equal to y. here in the given above program we have to print the x value, so that it will be 100.
