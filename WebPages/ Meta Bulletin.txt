Some of these creators are writers and academics, while others are industry experts and public figures. We define â€œindependent creatorsâ€? as individual journalists or subject matter experts who are not contractually bound to write exclusively for a platform or publisher. We'll take a careful approach to expanding availability to more creators over time, but we are not currently accepting new creators to Bulletin. Do I have to pay to access articles and podcasts?It depends. Some of the Bulletin content exists behind a paywall, and you can access premium benefits (subscriber-only Facebook groups, badges and more) if you pay for a subscription. If youâ€™re not ready to pay, thereâ€™s still a lot of free content to enjoy. How do transactions with Bulletin creators work?Your payments will be easily and securely processed using Facebook Pay. Facebook will not take a cut of the revenue from Bulletin creators at launch. Each Bulletin creator can choose their own prices for subscriptions. Where can I find Bulletin articles and podcasts?Bulletin articles and podcasts can be found on individual creator publication pages, your Facebook News Feed and within the News section of Facebook. Why is the product on a separate website and not on the Facebook App?We built Bulletin on a separate website to enable creators to grow their audience in ways that are not exclusively dependent on the Facebook platform. Branding on Bulletin publications will be creator-first and readers will not need to be logged into Facebook to read free content. What are plans for international creators/creators outside the US to be included?We are primarily launching with US creators, and there are only 2 non-US creators at launch. The Bulletin website itself will be available worldwide, and we will look to include more international creators after our beta program launch.
