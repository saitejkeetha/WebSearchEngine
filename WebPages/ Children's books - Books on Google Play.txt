Ada Twist, Scientist, from powerhouse team Andrea Beaty and David Roberts, is a celebration of STEM, perseverance, and passion. Â  Like her classmates, builder Iggy and inventor Rosie, scientist Ada, a character of color, has a boundless imagination and has always been hopelessly curious. Why are there pointy things stuck to a rose? Why are there hairs growing inside your nose? When her house fills with a horrific, toe-curling smell, Ada knows itâ€™s up to her to find the source. What would you do with a problem like this? Not afraid of failure, Ada embarks on a fact-finding mission and conducts scientific experiments, all in the name of discovery. But, this time, her experiments lead to even more stink and get her into trouble! Â  Inspired by real-life makers such as Ada Lovelace and Marie Curie, Ada Twist, Scientist champions girl power and women scientists, and brings welcome diversity to picture books about girls in science. Touching on themes of never giving up and problem solving, Ada comes to learn that her questions might not always lead to answers, but rather to more questions. She may never find the source of the stink, but with a supportive family and the space to figure it out, sheâ€™ll be able to feed her curiosity in the ways a young scientist should. Â  Iggy Peck and Rosie Revere have earned their places among the most beloved childrenâ€™s characters, and they have inspired countless kids and adults to follow their dreams and passions. Now in her own charming and witty picture book, determined Ada Twist, with her boundless curiosity for science and love of the question â€œWhy?,â€? is destined to join these two favorites.Â  The book is the perfect tool to remind both young girls and women that they have the intelligence and perseverance to achieve their dreams. $21.95 Rosie Revere, Engineer Andrea Beaty New York Times Bestseller Rosie may seem quiet during the day, but at night sheâ€™s a brilliant inventor of gizmos and gadgets who dreams of becoming a great engineer. When her great-great-aunt Rose (Rosie the Riveter) comes for a visit and mentions her one unfinished goalâ€”to flyâ€”Rosie sets to work building a contraption to make her auntâ€™s dream come true. But when her contraption doesnâ€™t fly but rather hovers for a moment and then crashes, Rosie deems the invention a failure. On the contrary, Aunt Rose insists that Rosieâ€™s contraption was a raging success: you can only truly fail, she explains, if you quit. From the powerhouse author-illustrator team of Iggy Peck, Architect comes Rosie Revere, Engineer, another charming, witty picture book about believing in yourself and pursuing your passion. Ada Twist, Scientist, the companion picture book featuring the next kid from Iggy Peck's class, is available in September 2016.!--?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /-- Praise for Rosie Revere, Engineer"Comically detailed mixed-media illustrations that keep the mood light and emphasize Rosieâ€™s creativity at every turn."â€”Publishers Weekly "The detritus of Rosieâ€™s collections is fascinating, from broken dolls and stuffed animals to nails, tools, pencils, old lamps and possibly an erector set.

Â  So begins a new adventure for Ada, and for Susan Smith, the woman who is forced to take the two kids in. As Ada teaches herself to ride a pony, learns to read, and watches for German spies, she begins to trust Susanâ€”and Susan begins to love Ada and Jamie.

Palacio #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER â€¢ Millions of peopleÂ have fallenÂ in love with Auggie Pullman, an ordinary boy with an extraordinary faceâ€”who shows us that kindness brings us together no matter how far apart we are. Read the book that inspired the Choose Kind movement, a major motion picture, and the critically acclaimed graphic novel White Bird. And don't miss R.J. Palacio's highly anticipated new novel, Pony, available now! I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse. Â  August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kidâ€”but his new classmates canâ€™t get past Auggieâ€™s extraordinary face.
