A - Statement encapsulates an SQL statement which is passed to the database to be parsed and compiled. B - Statement encapsulates an SQL statement which is passed to the database to be planned and executed. C - Both of the above. D - none of the above. Answer : C Explanation Statement encapsulates an SQL statement which is passed to the database to be parsed, compiled, planned and executed. Show Answer Q 2 - In which of the following type of ResultSet, the cursor can only move forward in the result set? A - ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY B - ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE C - ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE D - None of the above. Answer : A Explanation ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY: The cursor can only move forward in the result set. Show Answer Q 3 - Which of the following type of JDBC driver, uses database native protocol? A - JDBC-ODBC Bridge plus ODBC driver B - Native-API, partly Java driver C - JDBC-Net, pure Java driver D - Native-protocol, pure Java driver Answer : D Explanation Native-protocol, pure Java driver, uses database native protocol. Show Answer Q 4 - Which of the following is not a valid type of statement in JDBC? A - Statement B - PreparedStatement C - CallableStatement D - QueryStatement Answer : D Explanation QueryStatement is not a valid type of statement in JDBC. Show Answer Q 5 - Which of the following is correct about PreparedStatement? A - PreparedStatement allows mapping different requests with same prepared statement but different arguments to execute the same execution plan. B - Prepared statements are more secure because they use bind variables, which can prevent SQL injection attack. C - Both of the above. D - None of the above. Answer : C Explanation PreparedStatement allows mapping different requests with same prepared statement but different arguments to execute the same execution plan. Prepared statements are more secure because they use bind variables, which can prevent SQL injection attack. Show Answer Q 6 - How does JDBC handle the data types of Java and database? A - The JDBC driver converts the Java data type to the appropriate JDBC type before sending it to the database. B - It uses a default mapping for most data types. C - Both of the above. D - None of the above. Answer : C Explanation The JDBC driver converts the Java data type to the appropriate JDBC type before sending it to the database. It uses a default mapping for most data types. For example, a Java int is converted to an SQL INTEGER. Show Answer Q 7 - Which of the following is correct about connection pooling? A - Application server like WebLogic, WebSphere, jBoss and Tomcat provides the facilities to configure connection pooling. B - components like Apache Commons DBCP Component can be used to configure connection pooling. C - Both of the above. D - None of the above. Answer : C Explanation If you use an application server like WebLogic, WebSphere, jBoss, Tomcat. , then your application server provides the facilities to configure for connection pooling. If you are not using an application server then components like Apache Commons DBCP Component can be used. Show Answer Q 8 - Which of the following is correct about setFetchSize(int)? A - setFetchSize(int) defines the number of rows that will be read from the database when the ResultSet needs more rows. B - setFetchSize(int) affects how the database returns the ResultSet data. C - Both of the above. D - None of the above. Answer : C Explanation setMaxRows(int) method of the ResultSet specifies how many rows a ResultSet can contain at a time. setMaxRows(int) affects the client side JDBC object. Show Answer Q 9 - Which of the following is true about 'dirty read'? A - In typical database transactions, say one transaction reads and changes the value while the second transaction reads the value before committing or rolling back by the first transaction. This reading process is called as 'dirty read'. B - There is always a chance that the first transaction might rollback the change which causes the second transaction reads an invalid value. C - Both of the above. D - None of the above. Answer : C Explanation In typical database transactions, say one transaction reads and changes the value while the second transaction reads the value before committing or rolling back by the first transaction. This reading process is called as 'dirty read'. Because there is always a chance that the first transaction might rollback the change which causes the second transaction reads an invalid value. Show Answer Q 10 - New drivers can be plugged-in to the JDBC API without changing the client code. A - true B - false Answer : A Explanation New drivers can be plugged-in to the JDBC API without changing the client code.
