Ratings are the responsibility of the app developers and the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC). In South Korea, ratings have been approved by the Game Rating Administration Committee (GRAC). How Google Play uses ratings We use content ratings to: Inform you of potentially objectionable content within an app. Block or filter your content in certain territories or to specific users where required. What content ratings tell you about an app or game Age-based ratings & description Content ratings are used to describe the minimum maturity level of content in apps. However, content ratings don't tell you whether an app is designed for users of a specific age. Ratings are typically based on a number of factors, including sexual content, violence, drugs, gambling, and profane language. Tap Read more on an app's details page to see a description of why the app got its rating. Interactive features In the "Read more" section on the app's details page, you can learn more about the app's interactive features. This includes things like whether an app shares a user's location, or if it allows users to interact with each other. An app's interactive features are separate from its content rating. Unrated apps Not all apps in the Google Play store have a rating. Unrated apps are treated like high-maturity apps for the purpose of parental controls until they get a rating. If you set up parental controls to restrict apps and games to a certain rating, you won't see any Unrated apps in the Play Store app. To learn more ways to find content that's appropriate for your family, including setting up parental controls, read the Parent Guide to Google Play.  Find content ratings You can find content ratings for apps and games on the app's detail page under the app title. To learn more about an app's content rating, tap Read more. This shows more information about the maturity level of the content, and the app's interactive features. Where to find content ratings for instant apps To see the content rating for an instant app youâ€™ve used: Open the Google Play Store. At the top, search for your Instant app. Tap the app. Tap Read more. Look for the content rating under "More info."

Learn more on the ESRB website. Europe & Middle East Ratings in Europe and the Middle East are maintained by Pan European Game Information (PEGI). Countries Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and Vatican City. Ratings Rating Description PEGI 3 The content of apps with this rating is considered suitable for all age groups. Some violence in a comical context (typically cartoonlike - Bugs Bunny or Tom & Jerry - forms of violence) is acceptable. A child should not be able to associate the character on the screen with real life characters, they should be distinctly fantasy. The app should not contain any sounds or pictures that are likely to scare young children. No bad language should be heard. PEGI 7 Any app that would normally be rated at 3 but contains some scenes or sounds that can possibly be frightening for children may be considered suitable in this category. There can only be very mild violence in a PEGI 7 app, like implied violence or non-detailed, non-realistic violence. PEGI 12 Games or apps that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters, or non-graphic violence towards human-looking characters or animals would fall in this age category, as well as nudity of a slightly more graphic nature and simulated gambling. Any bad language in this category must be mild and fall short of sexual expletives. PEGI 16 Once the depiction of violence or sexual activity reaches a stage that looks the same as would be expected in real life, this rating is applied. Stronger inappropriate language, encouraging the use of tobacco or drugs and depicting criminal activities can be content of apps that are rated 16. PEGI 18 The adult classification is applied when the level of violence reaches a stage where it becomes a depiction of gross violence and/or includes elements of specific types of violence (motiveless killing, violence towards defenceless characters or sexual violence). It may also include graphic sexual content, discrimination or the glamorisation of illegal drugs use. PARENTAL GUIDANCE RECOMMENDED Apps do not always have predefined content that can be classified beforehand. Certain apps function as portals (e.g. to stream content), offering a broad, variable range of content from which consumers can choose. For these apps, we use the parental guidance icon, alerting parents that the app may provide access to content that is not appropriate for their child, although other, age-appropriate content may also be available, depending on the selection of the user. Learn more on the PEGI website Germany Ratings in Germany are maintained by Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (USK). Rating Description All ages Apps without age restriction feature contents without youth protection relevance. They can be directly aimed at children and young persons but also at an adult audience. For instance, utility programs, product catalogues or tool apps fall into this category as well as social networks in which all user-generated content is being thoroughly reviewed, filtered or moderated. USK: Ages 6 and above Apps in this category can contain elements that may not be appropriate for pre-school children. They may contain occasional scary moments, a low accumulation of mild cursing or subtle erotic innuendo. If violent imageries are present they remain abstract and are not decisive for the overall product. Games in this age category can still be categorized as family-friendly but involve more exciting and competitive aspects. USK: Ages 12 and above Apps in this category can have an impairing effect on younger children through the inclusion of scary elements, shock effects, some explicit language, sexual contents or occasional violent imageries. Games in this category can feature much more of a competitive edge and hectic gameplay. Please keep in mind that in social networks or user-generated content might generally contribute to the youth protection relevance. USK: Ages 16 and above Some realistically designed displays of violence, an accumulation of shock and horror elements, consistently explicit language or apps with an erotic or sexual focus are summarized in this category. Games frequently feature armed combat, a framework story and military missions. The genres in this categorization also include action adventures, military strategy games and first person shooter. USK: Ages 18 and above Among other aspects such as the unquestioned display of drug use for example, realistic and explicit violence is the most common reason for the 18+ classification of these apps. Games in this age category virtually always involve violent game concepts that are prominent in the majority of game objectives. Learn more on the USK website Australia (Games only) Ratings in Australia are maintained by the Australian Classification Board (ACB). For Games in the Play Store in Australia, the following ratings will be used. For other apps, we'll assign ratings described in the "Other countries" category.
