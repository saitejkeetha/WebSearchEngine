Â  The past may seem the safest place to be . . . but it is the most dangerous time to be alive. . . . Â  Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall were torn apart by the Jacobite Rising in 1746, and it took them twenty years to find each other again. Now the American Revolution threatens to do the same. Â  It is 1779 and Claire and Jamie are at last reunited with their daughter, Brianna, her husband, Roger, and their children on Fraserâ€™s Ridge. Having the family together is a dream the Frasers had thought impossible. Â  Yet even in the North Carolina backcountry, the effects of war are being felt. Tensions in the Colonies are great and local feelings run hot enough to boil Hellâ€™sÂ teakettle. Jamie knows loyalties among his tenants are split and it wonâ€™t be long until the war is on his doorstep. Â  Brianna and Roger have their own worry: that the dangers that provoked their escape from the twentieth century might catch up to them. Sometimes they question whether risking the perils of the 1700sâ€”among them disease, starvation, and an impending warâ€”was indeed the safer choice for their family. Â  Not so far away, young William Ransom is still coming to terms with the discovery of his true fatherâ€™s identityâ€”and thus his ownâ€”and Lord John Grey has reconciliations to make, and dangers to meet . . . on his sonâ€™sÂ behalf, and his own. Â  Meanwhile, the Revolutionary War creeps ever closer to Fraserâ€™sÂ Ridge. And with the family finally together, Jamie and Claire have more at stake than ever before. $15.99 Cytonic Book 3 From the #1Â New York TimesÂ bestselling author of the Reckoners series, the Mistborn trilogy, and the Stormlight Archive comes the third book in an epic series about a girl who will travel beyond the stars to save the world she loves from destruction. Spensaâ€™s life as a Defiant Defense Force pilot has been far from ordinary. She proved herself one of the best starfighters in the human enclave of Detritus and she saved her people from extermination at the hands of the Krellâ€”the enigmatic alien species that has been holding them captive for decades. Whatâ€™s more, she traveled light-years from home as an undercover spy to infiltrate the Superiority, where she learned of the galaxy beyond her small, desolate planet home. Â  Now, the Superiorityâ€”the governing galactic alliance bent on dominating all human lifeâ€”has started a galaxy-wide war. And Spensaâ€™s seen the weapons they plan to use to end it: the Delvers. Ancient, mysterious alien forces that can wipe out entire planetary systems in an instant. Spensa knows that no matter how many pilots the DDF has, there is no defeating this predator. Â  Except that Spensa is Cytonic. She faced down a Delver and saw something eerily familiar about it. And maybe, if sheâ€™s able to figure out what she is, she could be more than just another pilot in this unfolding war. She could save the galaxy. Â  The only way she can discover what she really is, though, is to leave behind all she knows and enter the Nowhere. A place from which few ever return. Â  To have courage means facing fear. And this mission is terrifying. Praise forÂ Skyward An Instant New York Times Bestseller AÂ Kirkus ReviewsÂ Best Book of the Year "Startling revelations and stakes-raising implications . . .

The world of magick and the world of man have long been estranged from one another. But some can walk between the twoâ€”including Breen Siobhan Kelly. She has just returned to Talamh, with her friend, Marco, whoâ€™s dazzled and disoriented by this realmâ€”a place filled with dragons and faeries and mermaids (but no WiFi, to his chagrin). In Talamh, Breen is not the ordinary young schoolteacher he knew her as. Here she is learning to embrace the powers of her true identity. Marco is welcomed kindly by her peopleâ€”and by Keegan, leader of the Fey. Keegan has trained Breen as a warrior, and his yearning for her has grown along with his admiration of her strength and skills. But one member of Breenâ€™s bloodline is not there to embrace her. Her grandfather, the outcast god Odran, plots to destroy Talamhâ€”and now all must unite to defeat his dark forces. There will be losses and sorrows, betrayal and bloodshed. But through it, Breen Siobhan Kelly will take the next step on the journey to becoming all that she was born to be. $14.99 Mercy David Baldacci FBI Agent Atlee Pineâ€™s harrowing search for her long-lost sister Mercy reaches a boiling point in this breakneck thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author David Baldacci.Â  Â  For her entire life, FBI agent Atlee Pine has been searching for her twin sister, Mercy, who was abducted at the age of six and never seen again. Mercyâ€™s disappearance left behind a damaged family that later shattered beyond repair when Atleeâ€™s parents inexplicably abandoned her. Â  Now, after a perilous investigation that nearly proved fatal, Atlee has finally discovered not only the reason behind her parentsâ€™ abandonment and Mercyâ€™s kidnapping, but also the most promising breakthrough yet: proof that Mercy survived her abduction and then escaped her captors many years ago.Â  Â  Though Atlee is tantalizingly close to her family at last, the final leg of her long road to Mercy will be the most treacherous yet. Mercy left at least one dead body behind before fleeing her captors years before. Atlee has no idea if her sister is still alive, and if so, how she has been surviving all this time. When the truth is finally revealed, Atlee Pine will face the greatest danger yet, and it may well cost her everything. $18.99 Flying Angels: A Novel Danielle Steel World War II brings together six remarkable young flight nurses, who face the challenges of war and its many heartbreaks and victories as unsung heroes, in this inspiring novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Danielle Steel.

Her brother, a talented young Navy pilot, had been stationed there, poised to fulfill their late fatherâ€™s distinguished legacy.

Driven to do whatever they can to serve, they enlist in the Army and embark on a new adventure as flight nurses.

One man â€“ visionary billionaire restaurant chain magnate T. R. Schmidt, Ph.D. â€“ has a Big Idea for reversing global warming, a master plan perhaps best described as â€œelemental.â€? But will it work? And just as important, what are the consequences for the planet and all of humanity should it be applied? Ranging from the Texas heartland to the Dutch royal palace in the Hague, from the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas to the sunbaked Chihuahuan Desert, Termination Shock brings together a disparate group of characters from different cultures and continents who grapple with the real-life repercussions of global warming. Ultimately, it asks the question: Might the cure be worse than the disease? Epic in scope while heartbreakingly human in perspective, Termination Shock sounds a clarion alarm, ponders potential solutions and dire risks, and wraps it all together in an exhilarating, witty, mind-expanding speculative adventure. $24.99 Star Wars: Thrawn Ascendancy (Book III: Lesser Evil) Book 3 NATIONAL BESTSELLER â€¢ The fate of the Chiss Ascendancy hangs in the balance in the epic finale of the Star Wars: Thrawn Ascendancy trilogy from Timothy Zahn.

It is led by the Nine Ruling Families, whose leadership stands as a bulwark of stability against the Chaos of the Unknown Regions.

Despite the efforts of the Expansionary Defense Fleet, the Ascendancy slips closer and closer to civil war. Â  The Chiss are no strangers to war. Their mythic status in the Chaos was earned through conflict and terrible deeds, some long buried. Until now. To ensure the Ascendancyâ€™s future, Thrawn will delve deep into its past, uncovering the dark secrets surrounding the ascension of the First Ruling Family. But the truth of a familyâ€™s legacy is only as strong as the legend that supports it. Even if that legend turns out to be a lie.

Including the only home he has ever known? $16.99 Tom Clancy Chain of Command Book 21 The United States has stared down many threats with President Jack Ryan at the helm, but what if heâ€™s not there when we need him?

The only bright spot is meeting Jamie, the charming new recruit on her brother Leviâ€™s hockey team. Yet even as Daunis falls for Jamie, she senses the dashing hockey star is hiding something. Everything comes to light when Daunis witnesses a shocking murder, thrusting her into an FBI investigation of a lethal new drug. Reluctantly, Daunis agrees to go undercover, drawing on her knowledge of chemistry and Ojibwe traditional medicine to track down the source. But the search for truth is more complicated than Daunis imagined, exposing secrets and old scars. At the same time, she grows concerned with an investigation that seems more focused on punishing the offenders than protecting the victims.

Gifted with "a remarkable ability to make us share her characters' feelings" (People), Picoult now explores the complex choices of the heart for a young Amish woman -- the compelling journey of discovery for an urban lawyer who befriends and protects her. The small town of Paradise, Pennsylvania, is a jewel in Lancaster County -- known for its picture-postcard landscapes and bucolic lifestyle. But that peace is shattered by the discovery of a dead infant in the barn of an Amish farmer. A police investigation quickly leads to two startling disclosures: the newborn's mother is an unmarried Amish woman, eighteen-year-old Katie Fisher. And the infant did not die of natural causes. Although Katie denies the medical proof that she gave birth to the child, circumstantial evidence leads to her arrest for the murder of her baby. One hundred miles away, Philadelphia defense attorney Ellie Hathaway has achieved an enviable, high-profile career. But her latest court "victory" has set the sands shifting beneath her. Single at thirty-nine and unsatisfied with her relationship, Ellie doesn't look back when she turns down her chance to make partner and takes off for an open-ended stay at her great-aunt's home in Paradise. Fate brings her to Katie Fisher. Suddenly, Ellie sees the chance to defend a client who truly needs her, not just one who can afford her. But taking on this case challenges Ellie in more ways than one. She finds herself not only in a clash of wills with a client who does not want to be defended but also in a clash of cultures with a people whose channels of justice are markedly different from her own. Immersing herself in Katie Fisher's life -- and in a world founded on faith, humility, duty, and honesty -- Ellie begins to understand the pressures and sacrifices of those who to live "plain." As she peels away the layers of fact and fantasy, Ellie calls on an old friend for guidance. Now, just as this man from Ellie's past reenters her life, she must uncover the truth about a complex case, a tragic loss, the bonds of love -- and her own deepest fears and desires. Moving seamlessly from psychological drama to courtroom suspense, Plain Truth is a triumph of contemporary storytelling. Jodi Picoult presents a fascinating portrait of Amish life rarely witnessed by those outside the faith -- and discovers a place where circumstances are not always what they seem, where love meets falsehood, and where relationships grow strong enough to span two worlds. $12.99$2.99 Hawkeye (2012-2015): My Life As A Weapon Vol 1, #1-6 Collects Hawkeye #1-5 & Young Avengers Presents #6.Ã¿ The breakout star of this summer's blockbuster Avengers film, Clint Barton - aka the self-made hero Hawkeye - fights for justice!

By turns darkly comic and heartbreakingly sad, Sweetland is a deeply suspenseful story about one man's struggles against the forces of nature and the ruins of memory. Â Â Â Â Â For twelve generations, when the fish were plentiful and when they all-but disappeared, the inhabitants of this remote island in Newfoundland have lived and died together. Now, in the second decade of the 21st century, they are facing resettlement, and each has been offered a generous compensation package to leave. But the money is offered with a proviso: everyone has to go; the government won't be responsible for one crazy coot who chooses to stay alone on an island. Â Â Â Â  That coot is Moses Sweetland. Motivated in part by a sense of history and belonging, haunted by memories of the short and lonely time he spent away from his home as a younger man, and concerned that his somewhat eccentric great-nephew will wilt on the mainland, Moses refuses to leave. But in the face of determined, sometimes violent, opposition from his family and his friends, Sweetland is eventually swayed to sign on to the government's plan. Then a tragic accident prompts him to fake his own death and stay on the deserted island. As he manages a desperately diminishing food supply, and battles against the ravages of weather, Sweetland finds himself in the company of the vibrant ghosts of the former islanders, whose porch lights still seem to turn on at night. $11.99$3.99 Find your next favorite book See more Midnight Sun Stephenie Meyer #1 bestselling author Stephenie Meyer makes a triumphant return to the world of Twilight with this highly anticipated companion: the iconic love story of Bella and Edward told from the vampire's point of view.

For decades, weâ€™ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Letâ€™s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesnâ€™t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it isâ€”a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, letâ€™s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limitedâ€”"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives. $12.99 Untamed Glennon Doyle #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER â€¢ Over two million copies sold! â€œPacked with incredible insight about what it means to be a woman today.â€?â€”Reese Witherspoon (Reeseâ€™s Book Club Pick) In her most revealing and powerful memoir yet,Â the activist, speaker, bestselling author, and â€œpatron saint of female empowermentâ€? (People) explores the joy and peace we discover when weÂ stop striving to meet othersâ€™ expectations and start trusting the voice deep within us. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY O: The Oprah Magazine â€¢ The Washington Post â€¢ Cosmopolitan â€¢ Marie Claire â€¢ Bloomberg â€¢ Parade â€¢ â€œUntamed will liberate womenâ€”emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It is phenomenal.â€?â€”Elizabeth Gilbert, author of City of Girls and Eat Pray Love This is how you find yourself. There is a voice of longing inside each woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: Wasnâ€™t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontentâ€”even from ourselves. For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voiceâ€”the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the worldâ€™s expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living. Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story ofÂ navigating divorce, forming aÂ new blended family,Â and discovering thatÂ theÂ brokenness or wholeness of a family depends notÂ on itsÂ structure butÂ onÂ each memberâ€™s ability toÂ bringÂ herÂ fullÂ self to the table.Â And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is. Untamed shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are, the luckier we get. $16.99 Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and into Your Life Gary John Bishop Joining the ranks of The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, You Are a Badas*, and F*ck Feelings comes this refreshing, BS-free, self-empowerment guide that offers an honest, no-nonsense, tough-love approach to help you move past self-imposed limitations. Are you tired of feeling fu*ked up? If you are, Gary John Bishop has the answer. In this straightforward handbook, he gives you the tools and advice you need to demolish the slag weighing you down and become the truly unfu*ked version of yourself. ''Wake up to the miracle you are,'' he directs. ''Here's what you've forgotten: You're a fu*king miracle of being.'' It isn't other people that are standing in your way, it isn't even your circumstances that are blocking your ability to thrive, it's yourself and the negative self-talk you keep telling yourself.

This is the story of Offred, one of the unfortunate â€œHandmaidsâ€? under the new social order who have only one purpose: to breed. In Gilead, where women are prohibited from holding jobs, reading, and forming friendships, Offredâ€™ s persistent memories of life in the â€œtime beforeâ€? and her will to survive are acts of rebellion.

Trump In this revelatory, authoritative portrait of Donald J. Trump and the toxic family that made him, Mary L. Trump, a trained clinical psychologist and Donaldâ€™s only niece, shines a bright light on the dark history of their family in order to explain how her uncle became the man who now threatens the worldâ€™s health, economic security, and social fabric. Mary Trump spent much of her childhood in her grandparentsâ€™ large, imposing house in the heart of Queens, New York, where Donald and his four siblings grew up. She describes a nightmare of traumas, destructive relationships, and a tragic combination of neglect and abuse. She explains how specific events and general family patterns created the damaged man who currently occupies the Oval Office, including the strange and harmful relationship between Fred Trump and his two oldest sons, Fred Jr. and Donald. A firsthand witness to countless holiday meals and interactions, Mary brings an incisive wit and unexpected humor to sometimes grim, often confounding family events. She recounts in unsparing detail everything from her uncle Donaldâ€™s place in the family spotlight and Ivanaâ€™s penchant for regifting to her grandmotherâ€™s frequent injuries and illnesses and the appalling way Donald, Fred Trumpâ€™s favorite son, dismissed and derided him when he began to succumb to Alzheimerâ€™s. Numerous pundits, armchair psychologists, and journalists have sought to parse Donald J. Trumpâ€™s lethal flaws. Mary L. Trump has the education, insight, and intimate familiarity needed to reveal what makes Donald, and the rest of her clan, tick. She alone can recount this fascinating, unnerving saga, not just because of her insiderâ€™s perspective but also because she is the only Trump willing to tell the truth about one of the worldâ€™s most powerful and dysfunctional families. $14.99 Peace Talks Book 16 HARRY DRESDEN IS BACK AND READY FOR ACTION, in the new entry in the #1 New York Times bestselling Dresden Files.

Still, Tessaâ€™s not sure she can endure one more broken promise.

Will he change...for love? $12.99 Advice for a better life See more Untamed Glennon Doyle #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER â€¢ Over two million copies sold! â€œPacked with incredible insight about what it means to be a woman today.â€?â€”Reese Witherspoon (Reeseâ€™s Book Club Pick) In her most revealing and powerful memoir yet,Â the activist, speaker, bestselling author, and â€œpatron saint of female empowermentâ€? (People) explores the joy and peace we discover when weÂ stop striving to meet othersâ€™ expectations and start trusting the voice deep within us. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY O: The Oprah Magazine â€¢ The Washington Post â€¢ Cosmopolitan â€¢ Marie Claire â€¢ Bloomberg â€¢ Parade â€¢ â€œUntamed will liberate womenâ€”emotionally, spiritually, and physically. It is phenomenal.â€?â€”Elizabeth Gilbert, author of City of Girls and Eat Pray Love This is how you find yourself. There is a voice of longing inside each woman. We strive so mightily to be good: good partners, daughters, mothers, employees, and friends. We hope all this striving will make us feel alive. Instead, it leaves us feeling weary, stuck, overwhelmed, and underwhelmed. We look at our lives and wonder: Wasnâ€™t it all supposed to be more beautiful than this? We quickly silence that question, telling ourselves to be grateful, hiding our discontentâ€”even from ourselves. For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own discontent. Then, while speaking at a conference, she looked at a woman across the room and fell instantly in love. Three words flooded her mind: There She Is. At first, Glennon assumed these words came to her from on high. But she soon realized they had come to her from within. This was her own voiceâ€”the one she had buried beneath decades of numbing addictions, cultural conditioning, and institutional allegiances. This was the voice of the girl she had been before the world told her who to be. Glennon decided to quit abandoning herself and to instead abandon the worldâ€™s expectations of her. She quit being good so she could be free. She quit pleasing and started living. Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story ofÂ navigating divorce, forming aÂ new blended family,Â and discovering thatÂ theÂ brokenness or wholeness of a family depends notÂ on itsÂ structure butÂ onÂ each memberâ€™s ability toÂ bringÂ herÂ fullÂ self to the table.Â And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is. Untamed shows us how to be brave. As Glennon insists: The braver we are, the luckier we get. $16.99 Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World Admiral William H. McRaven Based on a Navy SEAL's inspiring graduation speech, this #1 New York Times bestseller of powerful life lessons "should be read by every leader in America" (Wall Street Journal). If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed. On May 17, 2014, Admiral William H. McRaven addressed the graduating class of the University of Texas at Austin on their Commencement day. Taking inspiration from the university's slogan, "What starts here changes the world," he shared the ten principles he learned during Navy Seal training that helped him overcome challenges not only in his training and long Naval career, but also throughout his life; and he explained how anyone can use these basic lessons to change themselves-and the world-for the better. Admiral McRaven's original speech went viral with over 10 million views. Building on the core tenets laid out in his speech, McRaven now recounts tales from his own life and from those of people he encountered during his military service who dealt with hardship and made tough decisions with determination, compassion, honor, and courage. Told with great humility and optimism, this timeless book provides simple wisdom, practical advice, and words of encouragement that will inspire readers to achieve more, even in life's darkest moments.

This is the right book for right now. Yes, learning requires focus. But, unlearning and relearning requires much moreâ€”it requires choosing courage over comfort. In Think Again, Adam Grant weaves together research and storytelling to help us build the intellectual and emotional muscle we need to stay curious enough about the world to actually change it. Iâ€™ve never felt so hopeful about what I donâ€™t know.â€? â€”BrenÃ© Brown, Ph.D., #1 New York Times bestselling author of Dare to Lead The bestselling author of Give and Take and Originals examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people's minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life Intelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there's another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval--and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people's minds--and our own. As Wharton's top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he's right but listen like he's wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You'll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don't have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It's an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom. $16.99 Will Will Smith The instant #1 New York Times bestseller! â€œIt's the best memoir I've ever read.â€? â€”Oprah Winfrey â€œWill SmithÂ isn't holding back in his bravely inspiring new memoir . . .Â An ultimately heartwarming read, Will provides a humane glimpse of the man behind the actor, producer and musician,Â as heÂ bares all his insecuritiesÂ and trauma.â€? â€”USA Today One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had. Will Smithâ€™s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic taleâ€”but itâ€™s only half the story. Â  Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.Â  Â  This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself. $16.99 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos Jordan B. Peterson #1 NATIONAL BESTSELLERÂ  #1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER What does everyone in the modern world need to know? Renowned psychologist Jordan B. Peterson's answer to this most difficult of questions uniquely combines the hard-won truths of ancient tradition with the stunning revelations of cutting-edge scientific research. Humorous, surprising and informative, Dr. Peterson tells us why skateboarding boys and girls must be left alone, what terrible fate awaits those who criticize too easily, and why you should always pet a cat when you meet one on the street. What does the nervous system of the lowly lobster have to tell us about standing up straight (with our shoulders back) and about success in life? Why did ancient Egyptians worship the capacity to pay careful attention as the highest of gods? What dreadful paths do people tread when they become resentful, arrogant and vengeful? Dr. Peterson journeys broadly, discussing discipline, freedom, adventure and responsibility, distilling the world's wisdom into 12 practical and profound rules for life. 12 Rules for LifeÂ shatters the modern commonplaces of science, faith and human nature, while transforming and ennobling the mind and spirit of its readers. $15.99 Greenlights Matthew McConaughey #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER â€¢ Discover the life-changing memoir that has inspired millions of readers throughÂ the Academy AwardÂ®â€“winning actorâ€™s unflinching honesty, unconventional wisdom, andÂ lessons learned the hard wayÂ about living with greater satisfaction. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE GUARDIAN â€œMcConaugheyâ€™s book invites us to grapple with the lessons of his life as he didâ€”and to see that the point was never to win, but to understand.â€?â€”Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Iâ€™ve been in this life for fifty years, been trying to work out its riddle for forty-two, and been keeping diaries of clues to that riddle for the last thirty-five. Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Â  Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with lifeâ€™s challengesâ€”how to get relative with the inevitableâ€”you can enjoy a state of success I call â€œcatching greenlights.â€? Â  So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Â  Hopefully, itâ€™s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilotâ€™s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. Â  Itâ€™s a love letter. To life. Â  Itâ€™s also a guide to catching more greenlightsâ€”and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too. Â  Good luck. $16.99 The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life Mark Manson #1 New York Times Bestseller Over 10 million copies sold In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. For decades, weâ€™ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Letâ€™s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesnâ€™t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it isâ€”a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, letâ€™s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limitedâ€”"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives. $12.99 Happy Sexy Millionaire: Unexpected Truths about Fulfilment, Love and Success Steven Bartlett THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER We are losing ourselves.
