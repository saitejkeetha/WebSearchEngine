From the risk of pooping in the tub, fears of drowning, bribes to get in, bribes to come out to the tears because water got in their eyes, baths aren’t always a walk in the park. Don’t even get me started on the fuss that happens when I have the wrong toys and the number of times I have to tell them to stop splashing me. That’s why I do not bathe my kids daily. For mother Jeni Marinucci, 'benign neglect parenting' is the best parenting style of all. How I Got Here I didn’t consult with a doctor, ask other parents or look up a single article online. I made a conscious decision from the time my kids were born that baths were going to be at the bottom of my list. In my head, I justified it by telling myself I’d rather be a sane mom who has sticky kids than an overstressed one who has squeaky clean kids. Please don't get it twisted. This doesn’t mean I don’t bathe my children. I give them baths two to three times a week. Sometimes more and sometimes less. It just depends on what they’ve been doing all day. If it’s a cold day and they’ve been inside, I’m not going to bathe them. Maybe I’ll change their clothes if they got food, marker, glue or bodily gunk on them. If it’s a hot day and they’ve sweat buckets, went to the beach or the playground, then I’m going to bathe them for sure. A Public Shaming Recently, we had a get-together with some friends and acquaintances. After dinner, all the adults sat around the table while the kids played in the living room. One of the moms mentioned how it’s going to be a long night for her because she still needs to give her kids baths and do their bedtime routines when they get home. All the other parents nodded and gave her a sympathetic look. I’m curious, so I ask her, “Do your kids get baths every day?” She looks at me with a shocked expression, “Of course. Ever since they were both babies. The baths helped calm them down and go to sleep.” I’m surprised so I kept asking, “But what about now that they’re not babies anymore?” She responded, “Doesn’t everyone give their kids baths daily?” I shrugged and said, “I don’t give my kids baths every day. It’s just too much for me with work and everything else in my life. I do it two to three times a week unless they’re super dirty or something.” Her tone became condescending: “That’s disgusting! You need to bathe your kids every day because it’s better for their skin and overall hygiene. I work too but I make time to give my kids baths.” I could feel my face flush with embarrassment; then my hands curled into fists as I prepared for my response. She just shamed me for not doing enough for my kids. My excuse as a working mom wasn’t enough since she’s apparently able to “do it all.” A Matter of Preference I calmly furthered my stance: “Our kids aren’t even five yet. I don’t think you’re supposed to clean their skin so often.” She barked, “No, the most recent research from dermatologists says it’s better for their skin.” At this point, I rolled my eyes and I stayed silent. The awkward silence was broken by one of the kids crying. As we were driving home that night, I pulled up my phone to Google what the guidelines were for bathing your kids. The American Academy of Dermatology states, “Children aged 6 - 11 need a bath at least once or twice a week, when they get dirty, such as playing in the mud, after being in a pool, lake, ocean, or other body of water and when they get sweaty or have body odour.” I wanted to text her a screenshot of this. I wanted to prove to her that I was doing what was right. I wanted to plan another get-together with that specific mom just so I could show her this. Janice Quirt isn't a 'snowplow parent' — she would rather her children learn from their failings. Who Needed Convincing More? Ultimately, it wasn’t her who needed convincing — it was me. One of the toughest things about being a working mom isn’t just the double-edged sword of guilt, it’s the constant internal debate of whether what you’ve done or haven’t done has any negative long-term consequences on your kids’ lives. And this happens even when I’m fully confident in a decision I’ve made. I can read all the latest parenting research studies, but for me what is right for my kids isn’t necessarily found online, through the unsolicited advice of another parent or from the guilt trips I put myself through. Parenting as I see it is found by trusting my gut, heart and instincts. So that's what takes the lead for me.  Share You might also like Ages: all Learning My Adoption Story - Part 3 Ages: all Stories My Autistic Son Has Nothing To Be Sorry For â€” He’s Wonderful, Thanks Ages: all Stories If How I Cope Isn’t Hurting Anyone, Then Let It Go Katharine Chan Katharine Chan, MSc, BSc, PMP, is an author of three books and a Top 30 Vancouver Mom Blogger.
