A - 10 B - 35 C - 20 D - 15 Answer : D Explanation A DL/I database can have 255 different segment types and 15 levels of hierarchy. Show Answer Q 7 - How many different types of segment can be there in a DLI database? A - 15 B - 255 C - 355 D - 155 Answer : B Explanation A DL/I database can have 255 different segment types and 15 levels of hierarchy Show Answer Q 8 - Which segment lies at the top of the hierarchy? A - Twin Segment B - Child Segment C - Root Segment D - None of these Answer : C Explanation The segment that lies at the top of the hierarchy is called the root segment. The root segment is the only segment through which all dependent segments are accessed. Show Answer Q 9 - How can we access the data in IMS DB? A - Sequential Processing B - Random Processing C - Both A & B D - None of these Answer : C Explanation Data can be processed in both the ways: Sequential & Random. Show Answer Q 10 - What is the predefined pattern for sequential processing? A - Down the hierarchy then left to right B - Down the hierarchy then right to left C - Top the hierarchy then left to right D - Top the hierarchy then right to left Answer : A Explanation Predefined pattern for accessing data in DL/I is first down the hierarchy, then left to right. Show Answer Q 11 - What does DBD stands for? A - Database Descriptor B - Data Description C - Database Description D - None of these Answer : A Explanation DBD stands for Database Descriptor. Show Answer Q 12 - What does DBDGEN stands for?
