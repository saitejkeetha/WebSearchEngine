Routing Routing define the rules for flow of messages between different systems at run time. Mapping As SAP PI is used to connect different applications or systems in a distributed environment that can be set up between different companies so there is a possibility that structure of data exchange between two components differs from each other. Mapping determines structure of data in a source system to structure of data in target system and conversion rules that are applied on data between source and target system. Show Answer Q 2 - In SAP PI installation, which of the following installation option provides run time engines-Integration Engine, Business Process Engine, and Advanced Adapter Engine for PI design and configuration? A - Advance Adapter Engine Extended B - Dual Usage type C - Stand alone D - None of these Answer : B Explanation Dual Usage Type This installation is based on ABAP and Java and provide tools for designing and configuring integration content and also these run time engines ? Integration Engine Business Process Engine Advanced Adapter Engine Show Answer Q 3 - In SAP PI architecture, which of the following is used for routing and mapping and provides central integration server services and mapping runtime for source and target system? A - Runtime Workbench B - Business Process Engine C - Integration Engine D - Central Advanced Adapter Engine AAE Answer : C Explanation Integration Engine This engine is used for routing and mapping and provides central integration server services. If source structure is different from target structure, integration engine calls mapping runtime as shown in below pic to convert source structure to target structure. Show Answer Q 4 - In latest releases when SAP PI moved to single stack system, new engine is known as Advanced Adapter Engine AAE contains? A - most of the adapters are Java stack and only two adapters are based on ABAP stack B - most of the adapters are ABAP stack and only two adapters are based on Java stack C - All are also moved to Java stack adapters. D - All are also moved to ABAP stack adapters. Answer : C Explanation In latest releases when SAP PI moved to single stack system, these two adapters are also moved to Java stack adapters and new engine is known as Advanced Adapter Engine AAE. Show Answer Q 5 - Which of the following contain objects like mapping, interfaces and process definitions in PI system?
