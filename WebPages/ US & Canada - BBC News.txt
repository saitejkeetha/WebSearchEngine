Posted at 17:0817:08 US governor alleges illegal migration from South Africa The governor of the US state of Texas has accused President Joe Biden of allowing illegal migration from South Africa. "Biden is doing nothing to stop immigrants from South Africa entering illegally," Greg Abbott, a critic of the US leader, tweeted. View more on twitterView more on twitter Over the weekend, Mr Biden banned travel from southern African countries over fears of the new Omacrion coronavirus, which was detected in South Africa.
