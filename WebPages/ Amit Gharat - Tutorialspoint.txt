He has built many personal projects in AngularJS/Angular and made some of them open source as well, such as directives, SPAs, and chrome extensions. He was fortunate to write AngularJS UI Development and AngularJS Directives in Traction (unpublished) back in 2015 for two of the largest UK based publishers. He has an excessive urge to share his programming experiences in an easy-to-understand language through his blog (http://amitgharat.wordpress.com). When not programming, he enjoys reading science-fiction, watching movies, and playing games on his brand new Playstation 4 Pro. This is his 3rd book.
