You will have to read all the given answers and click over the correct answer. If you are not sure about the answer then you can check the answer using Show Answer button. You can use Next Quiz button to check new set of questions in the quiz. Q 1 - What is the output for ? 'you are doing well' [2:999] A - 'you are doing well' B - ' ' C - Index error. D - 'u are doing well' Answer : D Explanation Slicing will never give us an error even if we give it too large of an index for the string. It will just return the widest matching slice it can. Show Answer Q 2 - What is output of following code ?  a = (1, 2) a[0] +=1 A - (1,1,2) B - 2 C - Type Error D - Syntax Error Answer : C Explanation TypeError ? â€˜tupleâ€™ object does not support item assignment because a tuple is immutable. Show Answer Q 3 - In the following options which are python libraries which are used for data analysis and scientific computations A - Numpy B - Scipy C - Pandas D - All the above Answer : D Explanation Numpy,Scipy,pandas are few libraries in python which are used for data analysis and scientific computations. Show Answer Q 4 - What is output for ? min(''hello world'') A - e B - a blank space character C - w D - None of the above. Answer : B Explanation python considers a blank space character as minimum value in a string. Show Answer Q 5 - What is the output of the following code?  import math def main(): math.cos(math.pi) main() print(main()) A - -1 B - None C - Error D - Math.pi not defined Answer : B Explanation None is printed because function does not return the value. Show Answer Q 6 - Guess the output ?  def main(): try: func() print(''print this after function call'') except ZeroDivisionError: print('Divided By Zero! Not Possible! ') except: print('Its an Exception!') def func(): print(1/0) main() A - â€˜Its an Exception!â€™ B - â€˜Divided By Zero! Not possible!â€™ C - â€˜print this after function callâ€™ followed by â€˜Divided By Zero! Not Possible!â€™ D - â€˜print this after function callâ€™ followed by â€˜Its an Exception!â€™ Answer : B Explanation The function â€˜funcâ€™ will not run because it contains an exception. So in try and expect block. The function called under try will not run and will move to except block which defines the type of exception present in the function â€˜funcâ€™. Thus block of statements present in except ZeroDivisionError is printed. Show Answer Q 7 - Which among them is correct(s) about Recursive Function? A - They are much faster than the normal functions. B - They take more space then the non-recursive functions. C - They can always be replaced by non-recursive functions. D - Using recursive functions however also gives a natural and straight forward simple solution for the program. Answer : B, C, D. Explanation Recursive function is used to make the code simpler. They are better version of non-recursive functions. Show Answer Q 8 - How to create a frame in Python? A - Frame = new.window() B - Frame = frame.new() C - Frame = Frame() D - Frame = window.new() Answer : C Explanation Frame() method is used to make a frame in python. Show Answer Q 9 - Select the correct code to create a button under a parent window with command processButton A - Button(set.text= ''Hello'' ) B - Button(window ,text= ''Ok'' ,fg= ''black '') C - Button(window ,text= ''Hello'' ,command=processButton) D - Button(text= ''hello'' ,command=processButton) Answer : C Explanation Button keyword is used to make a button in Python. To set the process button in command we assign the value processButton in the command. Any text value can be given to the button which is assigned under text keyword. Show Answer Q 10 - Which can be an Identifier among them in Python? A - 1abc B - $12a C - _xy1 D - @python Answer : C Explanation Because Identifiers start from letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by more letters or zero or underscores and digits (0 to 9). Python does not allow @ or $ or % within the identifier.
