Mock Test I Mock Test II Mock Test III Mock Test IV COBOL Mock Test I Q 1 - Which data type is not available in COBOL? A - Alphabetic (A) B - Long (L) C - Alphanumeric (X) D - Numeric (9) Answer : B Explanation Long data type is not available in COBOL. COBOL supports three data types Alphabetic, Numeric & Alphanumeric. Show Answer Q 2 - What does COBOL stand for? A - Common Business Oriented Language B - Common Business Object Language C - Common Oriented Business Language D - Common Object Business Language Answer : A Explanation COBOL stands for COmmon Business Oriented Language which was developed to automate the business process. Show Answer Q 3 - Which is the mandatory division in COBOL program? A - PROCEDURE DIVISION. B - IDENTIFICATION DIVISION C - DATA DIVISION D - ENVIRONMENT DIVISION Answer : B Explanation Identification division contains entries that is used to identify the program. This is the the first division and only mandatory division. Show Answer Q 4 - How is sign stored in a COMP-3 field? A - First Bit B - Last Bit C - First Nibble D - Last Nibble Answer : D Explanation In COMP-3 field, sign is stored in last nibble. Show Answer Q 5 - What will happen if you code GO BACK instead of STOP RUN in a stand alone COBOL program? A - Program will give run time error. B - Program will go in infinite loop. C - Program will execute normally. D - Program will throw compilation error. Answer : B Explanation A Stop run ends the unit of work and returns control to the operating system whereas GOBACK returns control to calling program. So if we code GO BACK instead of Stop Run, it will go in infinite loop. Show Answer Q 6 - Which of the following file opening mode is invalid in COBOL? A - APPEND B - INPUT C - OUTPUT D - EXTEND Answer : A Explanation Valid file opening modes in COBOL are INPUT, OUTPUT, I-O, and EXTEND. APPEND file mode is not available in COBOL. Show Answer Q 7 - What is the maximum size of a numeric field we can define in COBOL? A - 9(20) B - 9(18) C - 9(31) D - 9(10) Answer : B Explanation COBOL applications use 31 digit numeric fields. However, compiler only supports a maximum of 18 digits. So we use a maximum of 18 digits. Show Answer Q 8 - What is the mode in which you will OPEN a file for writing? A - OUTPUT B - EXTEND C - Either OUTPUT or EXTEND D - INPUT-OUTPUT Answer : C Explanation To write into a file, the file has to be opened in either OUTPUT or EXTEND mode. Show Answer Q 9 - What is 77 level used for? A - Renames B - Redefine C - Group Item D - Elementary Level Answer : D Explanation 77 level is an elementary level item which cannot be subdivided. Show Answer Q 10 - Where does AREA B in COBOL start from? A - 01 to 07 columns B - 12 to 72 columns C - 08 to 11 columns D - 73 to 80 columns Answer : B Explanation All COBOL statements must begin in area B which starts from 12 to 72 columns Show Answer Q 11 - Where does the FILE-CONTROL paragraph appear? A - Procedure Division B - Environment Division C - Identification Division D - Data Division Answer : B Explanation FILE-CONTROL paragraph appears in the Input-Ouput Section in the Environment Division which provides information of external data sets used in the program. Show Answer Q 12 - Can I redefine an X(10) field with a field of X(20)? A - No B - Yes Answer : B Explanation Yes we can define a X(10) to X(20) as Redefines causes both fields to start at the same location, but it is not a good coding practice. Show Answer Q 13 - What is the length of PIC 9.999? A - 4 B - 6 C - 5 D - 3 Answer : C Explanation Length of PIC 9.999 is 5 as '.' takes 1 byte. So total 1 byte for '.' and 4 bytes for 9. Show Answer Q 14 - How many times following loop will execute?  MOVE 5 TO X. PERFORM X TIMES. MOVE 10 TO X. END-PERFORM. A - 11 B - 5 C - 10 D - 15 Answer : B Explanation PERFORM loop will execute for 5 times. As it reads the first statement PERFORM 5 times. It replaces X with the value 5. You can try same code using Try it option available below:  IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. PROGRAM-ID. HELLO. DATA DIVISION. WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 01 X PIC 99. PROCEDURE DIVISION. MOVE 5 TO X. PERFORM X TIMES MOVE 10 TO X DISPLAY 'COUNT' END-PERFORM. STOP RUN. Show Answer Q 15 - Which cobol verb is used for updating a file? A - READ B - WRITE C - UPDATE D - REWRITE Answer : D Explanation Rewrite verb is used to update the records. File should be opened in I-O mode for rewrite operations. It can be used only after a successful Read operation. Rewrite verb overwrites the last record read. Show Answer Q 16 - Under which section we should make an entry in the program for a SORT file? A - FD B - SD C - MD D - None of these Answer : B Explanation For sorting a file, we should make an SD entry in File Section. Show Answer Q 17 - How you will declare a Half Word Binary in program? A - S9(8) COMP B - S9(4) COMP C - 9(8) COMP D - 9(4) COMP Answer : B Explanation S9(4) COMP is used to declare a Half Word Binary. Show Answer Q 18 - If 436 value is moved to a PP999 PIC clause, then what is edited value taken? A - .00436 B - 00436 C - 436 D - 43600 Answer : A Explanation P is assumed decimal scaling position which is used to specify the location of an assumed decimal point when the point is not within the number that appears in the data item. .PIC PP999 means that numeric data item is of 3 characters and there are 5 positions after the decimal point. Show Answer Q 19 - Where can we specify OCCURS clause? A - Elementary Item B - Group Item C - Both A & B D - None of these Answer : C Explanation In array declaration, we can specify occurs clause on Elementary item as well as on Group item also. Show Answer Q 20 - Which utility is used for compiling COBOL program? A - IKJEFT01 B - IGYCRCTL C - IGYCTCRL D - None of these Answer : B Explanation IGCRCTL utility is used to compile a COBOL program. Show Answer Q 21 - How many bytes does a S9(7) SIGN TRAILING SEPARATE field occupy? A - 7 bytes B - 8 bytes C - 4 bytes D - 10 bytes Answer : B Explanation 9(7) will take 7 bytes and 1 byte for SIGN TRAILING SEPARATE, so total 8 bytes it will take. Show Answer Q 22 - What does SEARCH ALL do? A - Linear search B - Binary search C - Sequential search D - None of these Answer : B Explanation Search All is a binary search method, which is used to find elements inside the table. Show Answer Q 23 - In which division, Linkage Section comes? A - Identification Division B - Environment Division C - Data Division D - Procedure Division Answer : C Explanation Linkage section comes under data division which is used in called program. Show Answer Q 24 - In which division, Input-Output section? A - Identification Division B - Environment Division C - Data Division D - Procedure Division Answer : B Explanation Input-Output section comes under Environment division which provides information about the files to be used in the program. Show Answer Q 25 - Which of the following statement will give you â€˜Tutorialsâ€™ in TutorialsPoint string? A - TutorialsPoint(1:9) B - TutorialsPoint(9) C - TutorialsPoint(9:1) D - TutorialsPoint(9:9) Answer : A Explanation In STRING(A,B), A is the staring position and B id the number of digits to select.
