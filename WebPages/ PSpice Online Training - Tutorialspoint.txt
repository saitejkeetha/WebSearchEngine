PSpice is an acronym for Personal Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis. PSpice's strong point is that it helps the user to simulate the circuit design graphically on the computer before building a physical circuit. Hence, the designer can make any necessary changes on the prototype without modifying any hardware. As soon as the test design is completed, PSpice can help you to run a check on it before deciding to commit yourself to building a hardware model. Hence, PSpice allows you to check the operability of the circuit model in real life simulations to validate its viability. Since all the tests, designs and modifications are made over a terminal, the designer can save a lot of money that would have otherwise been spent on the building of models and modifying them. Audience This online training is designed for any student or professional with a need to understand the digital and analog electronics circuit design and testing it in simulation analysis. Basic knowledge on digital and analog electronics is the prerequisite for this course. 0 ? ? ? ? ?
