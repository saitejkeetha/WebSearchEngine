Technology component consists of NetWeaver Process Integration to integrate with SAP and non-SAP external systems, SAP GUI for configuration, and R/3 plugin for master data. Letâ€™s see each of the component under application and technology in detail ? SAP Supplier Relationship Management Server SAP SRM server includes SAP SRM server and SAP Bidding engine. SAP SRM is based on SAP NetWeaver application server and is available for different platforms and database. You can check all the releases of SAP SRM on SAP Market place under PAM.

In a standalone deployment model, all the procurement processing is performed in SAP SRM system and back end accounting system is used for invoice financial processing. In a Standalone scenario, purchase order management, shopping cart and goods receipt and invoices are processed in SRM system. Where do you use Standalone deployment model in SRM? When there is no operational backend system for material management and there exists only financial accounting systems in landscape. When you want to move all procurement activities in SAP SRM system and hence allow companies to decrease the work load on the backend procurement system by transferring buyers which are interested to procure from selected options. It is recommended for customers who want to maintain only minimal product data and only rely on supplier catalogs. What is the difference between classic and extended classic option? In a classing deployment model, you process the shopping cart in SAP SRM and supporting documents are processed in backend ERP system. You can perform goods receipt or invoices in any of the system. In extended classic deployment model, procurement process takes place in SAP SRM system and PO is generated in SRM system and a read only copy is created in back end ERP system. You can perform goods receipt or invoices in any of the system as in case of classic scenario. Where do you use Classic deployment scenario in SRM? For those customers who has a strong backend procurement system and where buyers do not want to use multiple systems for their operations. Provide an example of decoupled deployment scenario in SAP SRM? Consider a customer who wants to use the standalone model for certain indirect materials and routine services, the classic scenario for stock materials to utilize inventory and planning capabilities of backend materials management system, the extended classic scenario to perform effective supplier management to provide response for POâ€™s.
