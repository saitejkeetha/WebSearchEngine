CBC Production Facilities :core get="body"} Toronto Vancouver Halifax FR "Once again your CBC team has worked magic. As you may know we are putting together an aircraft in Studio 65. It came in pieces and the work involved to put it together is challenging. Kenny, Chris and their team have not only come up with creative solutions, but have done so with their typical 'can do' approach." Jim Corston Producer "Life with Boys" Life With Boys Thank you CBC team. You made things as easy as they could have been for our Red Bull Mini Drome event. We saw over 300 people come through the doors.  We will keep you in mind the next time we plan something suitable for the space. Cody Lynge Field Marketing Manager - Red Bull Canada Your leadership skills are amazing. Every member of the election team respects you and can't say enough about your abilities.  CBC is very lucky that you don't work for the competition. Fred Parker Chief Director National TV News & News Specials I think your venue is amazing and your staff and services are awesome. Mark Wyatt Partner & National Director of Sales & Sponsorship - Canadian Special Events "The crew at CBC Halifax care about the quality of the product, and go out of their way to make a client happy. In the end, it's really about what's on the screen - how it looks, and how it sounds. I am always happy with the results."
