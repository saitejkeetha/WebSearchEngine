The world of magick and the world of man have long been estranged from one another. But some can walk between the twoâ€”including Breen Siobhan Kelly. She has just returned to Talamh, with her friend, Marco, whoâ€™s dazzled and disoriented by this realmâ€”a place filled with dragons and faeries and mermaids (but no WiFi, to his chagrin). In Talamh, Breen is not the ordinary young schoolteacher he knew her as. Here she is learning to embrace the powers of her true identity. Marco is welcomed kindly by her peopleâ€”and by Keegan, leader of the Fey. Keegan has trained Breen as a warrior, and his yearning for her has grown along with his admiration of her strength and skills. But one member of Breenâ€™s bloodline is not there to embrace her. Her grandfather, the outcast god Odran, plots to destroy Talamhâ€”and now all must unite to defeat his dark forces. There will be losses and sorrows, betrayal and bloodshed. But through it, Breen Siobhan Kelly will take the next step on the journey to becoming all that she was born to be. A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press $44.75$34.42 Star Wars: Thrawn Ascendancy (Book III: Lesser Evil) Timothy Zahn NATIONAL BESTSELLER â€¢ The fate of the Chiss Ascendancy hangs in the balance in the epic finale of the Star Wars: Thrawn Ascendancy trilogy from Timothy Zahn. Â  For thousands of years the Chiss Ascendancy has been an island of calm, a center of power, and a beacon of integrity. It is led by the Nine Ruling Families, whose leadership stands as a bulwark of stability against the Chaos of the Unknown Regions. Â  But that stability has been eroded by a cunning foe who winnows away trust and loyalty in equal measure. Bonds of fidelity have given way to lines of division among the families. Despite the efforts of the Expansionary Defense Fleet, the Ascendancy slips closer and closer to civil war. Â  The Chiss are no strangers to war. Their mythic status in the Chaos was earned through conflict and terrible deeds, some long buried. Until now. To ensure the Ascendancyâ€™s future, Thrawn will delve deep into its past, uncovering the dark secrets surrounding the ascension of the First Ruling Family. But the truth of a familyâ€™s legacy is only as strong as the legend that supports it. Even if that legend turns out to be a lie. Â  To secure the salvation of the Ascendancy, is Thrawn willing to sacrifice everything? Including the only home he has ever known? $36.50$33.69 Will Will Smith One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had. Will Smithâ€™s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic taleâ€”but itâ€™s only half the story. Â  Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.Â  Â  This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself. *This audiobook includes a downloadable PDF of music credits. $34.00$29.95 The Dark Hours Michael Connelly â€œA masterpieceâ€?â€”LAPD detective RenÃ©e Ballard must join forces with Harry Bosch to find justice in a city scarred by fear and social unrest after a methodical killerÂ strikes on New Yearâ€™s Eve (Publishers Weekly). Thereâ€™s chaos in Hollywood at the end of the New Yearâ€™s Eve countdown. Working her graveyard shift, LAPD detective RenÃ©e Ballard waits out the traditional rain of lead as hundreds of revelers shoot their guns into the air. Only minutes after midnight, Ballard is called to a scene where a hardworking auto shop owner has been fatally hit by a bullet in the middle of a crowded street party. Â  Ballard quickly determines that the deadly bullet could not have fallen from the sky and that it is linked to another unsolved murderâ€”a case at one time worked by Detective Harry Bosch. At the same time, Ballard hunts a fiendish pair of serial rapists, the Midnight Men, who have been terrorizing women and leaving no trace. Â  Determined to solve both cases, Ballard feels like she is constantly running uphill in a police department indelibly changed by the pandemic and recent social unrest. It is a department so hampered by inertia and low morale that Ballard must go outside to the one detective she can count on: Harry Bosch. But as the two inexorable detectives work together to find out where old and new cases intersect, they must constantly look over their shoulders. The brutal predators they are tracking are ready to kill to keep their secrets hidden. Â  Unfolding with unstoppable drive and nail-biting intrigue, The Dark Hours shows that â€œrelentless on their own, Ballardâ€™s and Boschâ€™s combined skillsâ€¦could be combustibleâ€? (Los Angeles Times). $33.98$25.95 Betrayal: The Final Act of the Trump Show Jonathan Karl ***THE INSTANT NATIONAL BESTSELLER***Â  Picking up where the New York Times bestselling Front Row at the Trump Show left off, this is the explosive look at the aftermath of the electionâ€”and the events that followed Donald Trumpâ€™s leaving the White Houseâ€”fromÂ ABC News' chief Washington correspondent. Nobody is in a better position to tell the story of the shocking final chapter of the Trump show than Jonathan Karl. Â As the reporter who has known Donald Trump longer than any other White House correspondent, Karl told the story of Trumpâ€™s rise in the New York Times bestseller Front Row at the Trump Show. Now he tells the story of Trumpâ€™s downfall, complete with riveting behind-the-scenes accounts of some of the darkest days in the history of the American presidency and packed with original reporting and on-the-record interviews with central figures in this drama who are telling their stories for the first time. Â  This is a definitive account of what was really going on during the final weeks and months of the Trump presidency and what it means for the future of the Republican Party, by a reporter who was there for it all. He has been taunted, praised, and vilified by Donald Trump, and now Jonathan Karl finds himself in a singular position to deliver the truth. $27.00$19.95 Mercy David Baldacci FBI Agent Atlee Pineâ€™s harrowing search for her long-lost sister Mercy reaches a boiling point in this breakneck thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author David Baldacci.Â  Â  For her entire life, FBI agent Atlee Pine has been searching for her twin sister, Mercy, who was abducted at the age of six and never seen again. Mercyâ€™s disappearance left behind a damaged family that later shattered beyond repair when Atleeâ€™s parents inexplicably abandoned her. Â  Now, after a perilous investigation that nearly proved fatal, Atlee has finally discovered not only the reason behind her parentsâ€™ abandonment and Mercyâ€™s kidnapping, but also the most promising breakthrough yet: proof that Mercy survived her abduction and then escaped her captors many years ago.Â  Â  Though Atlee is tantalizingly close to her family at last, the final leg of her long road to Mercy will be the most treacherous yet. Mercy left at least one dead body behind before fleeing her captors years before. Atlee has no idea if her sister is still alive, and if so, how she has been surviving all this time. When the truth is finally revealed, Atlee Pine will face the greatest danger yet, and it may well cost her everything. $33.98$25.95 Tom Clancy Chain of Command Marc Cameron The United States has stared down many threats with President Jack Ryan at the helm, but what if heâ€™s not there when we need him? Thatâ€™s the question facing a nation in the most shocking entry in Tom Clancy's #1 New York Times bestselling series. A shadowy billionaire uses his fortune to further his corrupt ambitions. Along the way, heâ€™s toppled democratically elected governments and exacerbated divisions within stable nations. The competitors heâ€™s destroyed, the people heâ€™s hurt, theyâ€™re all just marks on a ledger. Now, heâ€™s ready to implement his most ambitious plan of all. Thereâ€™s only one force standing in his wayâ€”President Jack Ryan. How do you compel a man like Jack Ryan to bend? Heâ€™s personally faced down everything from the Russian navy to cartel killers. It will take more than political headwinds or media disfavor to cause him to turn from his duty to the American people, but every man has an Achilles heel. Jack Ryanâ€™s is his family. The answer is as simple as it is shocking. The billionaire has assembled an international team of the most ruthless mercenaries alive. Their missionâ€”kidnap the First Lady. $34.00$29.95 Fear No Evil James Patterson Alex Cross enters the final battle with the all-knowing genius who has stalked him and his family for years.

Because itâ€™s in the messes whereÂ we learn the mostâ€”as long as we slow down enough to realize what God is trying to show us.â€? Suddenly in the spotlight, twenty-four-year-old Hannah Brown realized that she wasnâ€™t sure what she wanted. After years of competing in beauty pageants, and then starring on The Bachelorette and Dancing with the Stars, she had become incredibly visible. There she was, in her early twenties, with millions around the world examining and weighing in on her every decision. She found herself wondering what it would mean to live on her terms. What it would mean to stop seeking approval from others and decideâ€”for the first timeâ€”what it was she wanted from her own life. An honest and earnest examination of her own mid-twenties, God Bless This Mess is a memoir that doesnâ€™t claim to have all the answers. Hannah knows she doesnâ€™t have all the answers. What she does have is the insight of someone who has spent critical years of her youth under public scrutiny. Thus what emerges is a quarter-life memoir that speaks to the set of difficulties young women face, and how to move through them with grace. By pushing against her engrained need to seek approval, and learning how to think critically about her own goals and desires, Hannah inspires others to do the sameâ€”and to embrace the messiness that comes hand-in-hand with self-discovery (even if that sometimes means falling flat on your face). Using her time on The Bachelorette as a launching pad, Hannah doesnâ€™t shy away from the most painful experiences of her life: moments when her faith was tested, when she feared it was lost, and the moments when she reclaimed it on national television. â€œAnd Jesus still loves me.â€? Fans will be inspired by the never-before-told stories: the ones about facing depression and anxiety during her pageant years, the ways in which therapy and journaling have proven to be a saving grace, and the previously private momentsâ€”both at home and on televisionâ€”that have shaped the starâ€™s outlook. Honest and emotionally urgent, God Bless This Mess is a reminder that true growth doesnâ€™t come without strifeâ€”and itâ€™s through those dark, messy moments that self-acceptance and love can bloom. $30.99$19.95 Talking to Canadians: A Memoir Rick Mercer INSTANT #1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER Canada's beloved comic genius tells his own story for the first time. Â  What is Rick Mercer going to do now? That was the question on everyone's lips when the beloved comedian retired his hugely successful TV show after 15 seasonsâ€”and at the peak of its popularity. The answer came not long after, when he roared back in a new role as stand-up-comedian, playing to sold-out houses wherever he appeared. Â  And then Covid-19 struck. And his legions of fans began asking again: What is Rick Mercer going to do now? Well, for one thing, he's been writing a comic masterpiece. For the first time, this most private of public figures has turned the spotlight on himself, in a memoir that's as revealing as it is hilarious. In riveting anecdotal style, Rick charts his rise from highly unpromising schoolboy (in his reports "the word 'disappointment' appeared a fair bit") to the heights of TV fame. Along the way came an amazing break when, not long out of his teens, his one-man show Show Me the Button, I'll Push It. Or, Charles Lynch Must Die, became an overnight sensationâ€”thanks in part to a bizarre ambush by its target, Charles Lynch himself. That's one story you wonâ€™t soon forget, and this book is full of them. Â  There's a tale of how little Rick helped himself to a tree from the neighbours' garden that's set to become a new Christmas classic. There's Rick the aspiring actor, braving "the scariest thing I have ever done in my life" by performing with the Newfoundland Shakespeare Company; unforgettable scenes with politicians of every variety, from Jean Chretien to George W. Bush to Stockwell Day; and a wealth of behind-the-scenes revelations about the origins and making of This Hour Has 22 Minutes, Made in Canada, and Talking to Americans. All leading of course to the greenlighting of that mega-hit, Rick Mercer Report . . . Â  It's a life so packed with incident (did we mention Bosnia and Kabul?) and laughter we can only hope that a future answer to "What is Rick Mercer going to do now?" is: "Write volume two." $32.95$28.95 Advice for a better life See more Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones James Clear The #1 New York Times bestseller.

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE GUARDIAN â€œMcConaugheyâ€™s book invites us to grapple with the lessons of his life as he didâ€”and to see that the point was never to win, but to understand.â€?â€”Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Iâ€™ve been in this life for fifty years, been trying to work out its riddle for forty-two, and been keeping diaries of clues to that riddle for the last thirty-five. Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Â  Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with lifeâ€™s challengesâ€”how to get relative with the inevitableâ€”you can enjoy a state of success I call â€œcatching greenlights.â€? Â  So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Â  Hopefully, itâ€™s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilotâ€™s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. Â  Itâ€™s a love letter. To life. Â  Itâ€™s also a guide to catching more greenlightsâ€”and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too. Â  Good luck. $27.00$19.95 The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life Mark Manson #1 New York Times Bestseller OverÂ 10 million copies sold In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. For decades, weâ€™ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Letâ€™s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesnâ€™t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it isâ€”a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, letâ€™s-all-feel-good mindset that has infectedÂ modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limitedâ€”"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives. $26.99$16.19 What Happened to You?: Conversations on Trauma, Resilience, and Healing Oprah Winfrey "[Oprah Winfrey and Bruce D. Perry] are both capable, likable narrators who are sincerely engaged with their subject matter...The performances of these two humanitarians make this a must-hear for anyone recovering from their traumatic past." -- AudioFile Magazine This program is read by the authors. Our earliest experiences shape our lives far down the road, and What Happened to You? provides powerful scientific and emotional insights into the behavioral patterns so many of us struggle to understand. â€œThrough this lens we can build a renewed sense of personal self-worth and ultimately recalibrate our responses to circumstances, situations, and relationships. It is, in other words, the key to reshaping our very lives.â€?â€”Oprah Winfrey This audiobook is going to change the way you see your life. Have you ever wondered "Why did I do that?" or "Why can't I just control my behavior?" Others may judge our reactions and think, "What's wrong with that person?" When questioning our emotions, it's easy to place the blame on ourselves; holding ourselves and those around us to an impossible standard. It's time we started asking a different question. Through deeply personal conversations, Oprah Winfrey and renowned brain and trauma expert Dr. Bruce Perry offer a groundbreaking and profound shift from asking â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with you?â€? to â€œWhat happened to you?â€? Here, Winfrey shares stories from her own past, understanding through experience the vulnerability that comes from facing trauma and adversity at a young age. In conversation throughout the audiobook, she and Dr. Perry focus on understanding people, behavior, and ourselves. Itâ€™s a subtle but profound shift in our approach to trauma, and itâ€™s one that allows us to understand our pasts in order to clear a path to our futureâ€”opening the door to resilience and healing in a proven, powerful way. A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books $26.99$14.95 Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know Adam Grant #1 New York Times Bestseller â€œTHIS. This is the right book for right now. Yes, learning requires focus. But, unlearning and relearning requires much moreâ€”it requires choosing courage over comfort. In Think Again, Adam Grant weaves together research and storytelling to help us build the intellectual and emotional muscle we need to stay curious enough about the world to actually change it. Iâ€™ve never felt so hopeful about what I donâ€™t know.â€? â€”BrenÃ© Brown, Ph.D., #1 New York Times bestselling author of Dare to Lead The bestselling author of Give and Take and Originals examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people's minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life Intelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there's another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval--and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people's minds--and our own. As Wharton's top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he's right but listen like he's wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You'll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don't have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It's an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom. $27.00$19.95 Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and into Your Life Gary John Bishop New York Times Bestseller Joining the ranks of The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, You Are a Badass, and F*ck Feelings comes this refreshing, BS-free, self-empowerment guide that offers an honest, no-nonsense, tough-love approach to help you move past self-imposed limitations.

"Wake up to the miracle you are," he directs. "Here's what you've forgotten: You're a fu*king miracle of being." It isn't other people that are standing in your way, it isn't even your circumstances that are blocking your ability to thrive, it's yourself and the negative self-talk you keep telling yourself. In Unfu*k Yourself, Bishop leads you through a series of seven assertions: I am willing I am wired to win I got this I embrace the uncertainty I am not my thoughts; I am what I do I am relentless I expect nothing and accept everything Lead the life you were meant to haveâ€”Unfu*k Yourself. $23.99$14.95 God Bless This Mess: Learning to Live and Love Through Life's Best (and Worst) Moments Hannah Brown â€œMy life was a complete mess, and God bless all of it.

"Wake up to the miracle you are," he directs. "Here's what you've forgotten: You're a fu*king miracle of being."

Geralt is a Witcher, a man whose magic powers, enhanced by long training and a mysterious elixir, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless hunter. Yet he is no ordinary killer.

For decades, weâ€™ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Letâ€™s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesnâ€™t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it isâ€”a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, letâ€™s-all-feel-good mindset that has infectedÂ modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limitedâ€”"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives. $26.99$16.19 Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones James Clear The #1 New York Times bestseller.

Trump In this revelatory, authoritative portrait of Donald J. Trump and the toxic family that made him, Mary L. Trump, a trained clinical psychologist and Donaldâ€™s only niece, shines a bright light on the dark history of their family in order to explain how her uncle became the man who now threatens the worldâ€™s health, economic security, and social fabric. Mary Trump spent much of her childhood in her grandparentsâ€™ large, imposing house in the heart of Queens, New York, where Donald and his four siblings grew up. She describes a nightmare of traumas, destructive relationships, and a tragic combination of neglect and abuse. She explains how specific events and general family patterns created the damaged man who currently occupies the Oval Office, including the strange and harmful relationship between Fred Trump and his two oldest sons, Fred Jr. and Donald. A firsthand witness to countless holiday meals and interactions, Mary brings an incisive wit and unexpected humor to sometimes grim, often confounding family events. She recounts in unsparing detail everything from her uncle Donaldâ€™s place in the family spotlight and Ivanaâ€™s penchant for regifting to her grandmotherâ€™s frequent injuries and illnesses and the appalling way Donald, Fred Trumpâ€™s favorite son, dismissed and derided him when he began to succumb to Alzheimerâ€™s. Numerous pundits, armchair psychologists, and journalists have sought to parse Donald J. Trumpâ€™s lethal flaws. Mary L. Trump has the education, insight, and intimate familiarity needed to reveal what makes Donald, and the rest of her clan, tick. She alone can recount this fascinating, unnerving saga, not just because of her insiderâ€™s perspective but also because she is the only Trump willing to tell the truth about one of the worldâ€™s most powerful and dysfunctional families. $25.99$16.95 Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don't Know Malcolm Gladwell A Best Book of the Year: The Financial Times, Bloomberg, Chicago Tribune, and Detroit Free Pres Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Outliers, offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers -- and why they often go wrong. How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true? While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's "Hell You Talmbout." Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world. $33.98$25.95 Sword of Destiny Andrzej Sapkowski Geralt the Witcher battles monsters, demons and prejudices alike in Sword of Destiny, the second collection of adventures in Andrzej Sapkowskiâ€™s groundbreaking epic fantasy series that inspired the Netflix show and the hit video games.

Dr. Peterson journeys broadly, discussing discipline, freedom, adventure and responsibility, distilling the world's wisdom into 12 practical and profound rules for life. 12 Rules for LifeÂ shatters the modern commonplaces of science, faith and human nature, while transforming and ennobling the mind and spirit of its readers. $34.95$32.26 White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism Dr. Robin DiAngelo The New York Times best-selling book exploring the counterproductive reactions white people have when their assumptions about race are challenged, and how these reactions maintain racial inequality. In this â€œvital, necessary, and beautiful bookâ€? (Michael Eric Dyson), antiracist educator Robin DiAngelo deftly illuminates the phenomenon of white fragility and â€œallows us to understand racism as a practice not restricted to â€˜bad peopleâ€™ (Claudia Rankine). Referring to the defensive moves that white people make when challenged racially, white fragility is characterized by emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and by behaviors including argumentation and silence. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and prevent any meaningful cross-racial dialogue. In this in-depth exploration, DiAngelo examines how white fragility develops, how it protects racial inequality, and what we can do to engage more constructively. $32.00$27.95 Explore Asian stories See more Interior Chinatown: A Novel Charles Yu 2020 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER "One of the funniest books of the year ... a delicious, ambitious Hollywood satire." â€”The Washington Post From the infinitely inventive author of How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe comes a deeply personal novel about race, pop culture, immigration, assimilation, and escaping the roles we are forced to play.

In their remote mountain village, Li-yan and her family align their lives around the seasons and the farming of tea. For the Akha people, ensconced in ritual and routine, life goes on as it has for generationsâ€”until a stranger appears at the village gate in a jeep, the first automobile any of the villagers has ever seen. The strangerâ€™s arrival marks the first entrance of the modern world in the lives of the Akha people. Slowly, Li-yan, one of the few educated girls on her mountain, begins to reject the customs that shaped her early life. When she has a baby out of wedlockâ€”conceived with a man her parents consider a poor choiceâ€”she rejects the tradition that would compel her to give the child over to be killed, and instead leaves her, wrapped in a blanket with a tea cake tucked in its folds, near an orphanage in a nearby city. As Li-yan comes into herself, leaving her insular village for an education, a business, and city life, her daughter, Haley, is raised in California by loving adoptive parents. Despite her privileged childhood, Haley wonders about her origins. Across the ocean Li-yan longs for her lost daughter.

Lydia is the favorite child of Marilyn and James Lee; their middle daughter, a girl who inherited her motherâ€™s bright blue eyes and her fatherâ€™s jet-black hair. Her parents are determined that Lydia will fulfill the dreams they were unable to pursueâ€”in Marilynâ€™s case that her daughter become a doctor rather than a homemaker, in Jamesâ€™ case that Lydia be popular at school, a girl with a busy social life and the center of every party. When Lydiaâ€™s body is found in the local lake, the delicate balancing act that has been keeping the Lee family together is destroyed, tumbling them into chaos. James, consumed by guilt, sets out on a reckless path that may destroy his marriage. Marilyn, devastated and vengeful, is determined to find a responsible party, no matter what the cost. Lydiaâ€™s older brother, Nathan, is certain the neighborhood bad boy Jack is somehow involved. But itâ€™s the youngest of the family, Hannah, who observes far more than anyone realizesâ€”and who may be the only one who knows the truth about what happened. A profoundly moving story of family, history, and the meaning of home, Everything I Never Told You is both a gripping page-turner and a sensitive family portrait, exploring the divisions between cultures and the rifts within a family and uncovering the ways in which mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, and husbands and wives struggle, all their lives, to understand one another. $25.08$14.95 The Poppy War: A Novel R.

Jemisinâ€™s Inheritance Trilogy. When Rin aced the Kejuâ€”the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academiesâ€”it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldnâ€™t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rinâ€™s guardians, who believed theyâ€™d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegardâ€”the most elite military school in Nikanâ€”was even more surprising. But surprises arenâ€™t always good. Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly powerâ€”an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much aliveâ€”and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school. For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . . Rinâ€™s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late. $47.99$38.39 Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China Jung Chang The story of three generations in twentieth-century China that blends the intimacy of memoir and the panoramic sweep of eyewitness historyâ€”a bestselling classic in thirty languages with more than ten million copies sold around the world, now with a new introduction from the author.

Chang was a Red Guard briefly at the age of fourteen, then worked as a peasant, a â€œbarefoot doctor,â€? a steelworker, and an electrician. As the story of each generation unfolds, Chang captures in gripping, movingâ€”and ultimately upliftingâ€”detail the cycles of violent drama visited on her own family and millions of others caught in the whirlwind of history. $39.99$36.91 Hey Google, tell me a Quidditch story Explore Hogwarts' favorite sport with Assistant Listen to a new series See more The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Douglas Adams NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER â€¢Â â€œExtremely funny . . . inspired lunacy . . .

And the book is The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy . . . which helpfully has the words DONâ€™T PANIC inscribed in large, friendly letters on its cover. Douglas Adamsâ€™s mega-selling pop-culture classic sends logic into orbit, plays havoc with both time and physics, offers up pithy commentary on such things as ballpoint pens, potted plants, and digital watches . . . and, most important, reveals the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything.

It is the summer of 1950â€”and a series of inexplicable events has struck Buckshaw, the decaying English mansion that Flaviaâ€™s family calls home. A dead bird is found on the doorstep, a postage stamp bizarrely pinned to its beak. Hours later, Flavia finds a man lying in the cucumber patch and watches him as he takes his dying breath. For Flavia, who is both appalled and delighted, life begins in earnest when murder comes to Buckshaw. â€œI wish I could say I was afraid, but I wasnâ€™t. Quite the contrary. This was by far the most interesting thing that had ever happened to me in my entire life.â€? To Flavia the investigation is the stuff of science: full of possibilities, contradictions, and connections. Soon her father, a man raising his three daughters alone, is seized, accused of murder. And in a police cell, during a violent thunderstorm, Colonel de Luce tells his daughter an astounding storyâ€”of a schoolboy friendship turned ugly, of a priceless object that vanished in a bizarre and brazen act of thievery, of a Latin teacher who flung himself to his death from the schoolâ€™s tower thirty years before. Now Flavia is armed with more than enough knowledge to tie two distant deaths together, to examine new suspects, and begin a search that will lead her all the way to the King of England himself. Of this much the girl is sure: her father is innocent of murderâ€”but protecting her and her sisters from something even worseâ€¦. An enthralling mystery, a piercing depiction of class and society, The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie is a masterfully told tale of deceptionsâ€”and a rich literary delight. $21.00$14.95 One Second After William R. Forstchen In a small North Carolina town, one man struggles to save his family after America loses a war that will send it back to the Dark Ages. Already cited on the floor of Congress and discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a book all Americans should read, One Second After is the story of a war scenario that could become all too terrifyingly real. Based on a real weapon-the electromagnetic pulse (EMP)-which may already be in the hands of our enemies, it is a truly realistic look at the awesome power of a weapon that can destroy the entire United States, literally within one second. In the tradition of On the Beach, Fail Safe, and Testament, this book, set in a typical American town, is a dire warning of what might be our future and our end. $28.85$16.95 Free audiobooks from Nightfire See more Come Join Us By The Fire, Season 2: 18 Short Horror Tales from Nightfire Various Authors Come Join Us by the Fire Season 2 is the second installment of Nightfire's audio horror anthology, featuring a wide collection of short stories from emerging voices in the horror genre as well as longtime fan favorites.

Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had. Will Smithâ€™s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic taleâ€”but itâ€™s only half the story. Â  Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.Â  Â  This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself. *This audiobook includes a downloadable PDF of music credits. $34.00$29.95 The Dark Hours Michael Connelly â€œA masterpieceâ€?â€”LAPD detective RenÃ©e Ballard must join forces with Harry Bosch to find justice in a city scarred by fear and social unrest after a methodical killerÂ strikes on New Yearâ€™s Eve (Publishers Weekly). Thereâ€™s chaos in Hollywood at the end of the New Yearâ€™s Eve countdown. Working her graveyard shift, LAPD detective RenÃ©e Ballard waits out the traditional rain of lead as hundreds of revelers shoot their guns into the air. Only minutes after midnight, Ballard is called to a scene where a hardworking auto shop owner has been fatally hit by a bullet in the middle of a crowded street party. Â  Ballard quickly determines that the deadly bullet could not have fallen from the sky and that it is linked to another unsolved murderâ€”a case at one time worked by Detective Harry Bosch. At the same time, Ballard hunts a fiendish pair of serial rapists, the Midnight Men, who have been terrorizing women and leaving no trace. Â  Determined to solve both cases, Ballard feels like she is constantly running uphill in a police department indelibly changed by the pandemic and recent social unrest. It is a department so hampered by inertia and low morale that Ballard must go outside to the one detective she can count on: Harry Bosch. But as the two inexorable detectives work together to find out where old and new cases intersect, they must constantly look over their shoulders. The brutal predators they are tracking are ready to kill to keep their secrets hidden. Â  Unfolding with unstoppable drive and nail-biting intrigue, The Dark Hours shows that â€œrelentless on their own, Ballardâ€™s and Boschâ€™s combined skillsâ€¦could be combustibleâ€?

A woman is slumped over the wheel. Â  Dead?Â No, nothing is what it seems.Â  The woman is Michaela Fenton, an army veteran turned FBI agent trying to find her twin brother, who mightÂ be mixed up with some dangerous people.Â Most of them would rather die than betray their terrifying leader, who has burrowed his influence deep into the nearby border town, a backwater that has seen better days.Â The mysterious Dendoncker rules from the shadows, out of sight and under the radar, keeping his dealings in the dark. Â  He would know the fate of Fentonâ€™s brother.Â  Reacher is good at finding people who donâ€™t want to be found, so he offers to help, despite feeling that FentonÂ is keeping secrets of her own.Â But a lifeÂ hangs in the balance.

Mercyâ€™s disappearance left behind a damaged family that later shattered beyond repair when Atleeâ€™s parents inexplicably abandoned her. Â  Now, after a perilous investigation that nearly proved fatal, Atlee has finally discovered not only the reason behind her parentsâ€™ abandonment and Mercyâ€™s kidnapping, but also the most promising breakthrough yet: proof that Mercy survived her abduction and then escaped her captors many years ago.Â  Â  Though Atlee is tantalizingly close to her family at last, the final leg of her long road to Mercy will be the most treacherous yet. Mercy left at least one dead body behind before fleeing her captors years before. Atlee has no idea if her sister is still alive, and if so, how she has been surviving all this time. When the truth is finally revealed, Atlee Pine will face the greatest danger yet, and it may well cost her everything. $33.98$25.95 Tom Clancy Chain of Command Marc Cameron The United States has stared down many threats with President Jack Ryan at the helm, but what if heâ€™s not there when we need him?

Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Â  Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with lifeâ€™s challengesâ€”how to get relative with the inevitableâ€”you can enjoy a state of success I call â€œcatching greenlights.â€? Â  So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Â  Hopefully, itâ€™s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilotâ€™s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. Â  Itâ€™s a love letter. To life. Â  Itâ€™s also a guide to catching more greenlightsâ€”and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too. Â  Good luck. $27.00$19.95 The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma Bessel van der Kolk, M.D. #1 New York Times bestseller â€œEssential reading for anyone interested in understanding and treating traumatic stress and the scope of its impact on society.â€? â€”Alexander McFarlane, Director of the Centre for Traumatic Stress Studies A pioneering researcher transforms our understanding of trauma and offers a bold new paradigm for healing in thisÂ New York TimesÂ bestseller Â  Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the worldâ€™s foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. InÂ The Body Keeps the Score, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferersâ€™ capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatmentsâ€”from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yogaâ€”that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brainâ€™s natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolkâ€™s own research and that of other leading specialists,Â The Body Keeps the ScoreÂ exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to healâ€”and offers new hope for reclaiming lives.

But the truth of a familyâ€™s legacy is only as strong as the legend that supports it. Even if that legend turns out to be a lie.

George Orwell depicts a gray, totalitarian world dominated by Big Brother and its vast network of agents, including the Thought Police, a world in which news is manufactured according to the authorities' will and people live tepid lives by rote. Winston Smith, the hero with no heroic qualities, longs only for truth and decency. But living in a social system in which privacy does not exist and where those with unorthodox ideas are brainwashed or put to death, he knows there is no hope for him. He knows even as he continues to pursue his forbidden love affair that eventually he will come to destruction. The year 1984 has come and gone, yet George Orwell's nightmare vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is still the great modern classic of negative Utopia. $26.34$14.95 Children of Dune: Book Three in the Dune Chronicles Frank Herbert Frank Herbert's bestselling science fiction series of all time continues!

Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had. Will Smithâ€™s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic taleâ€”but itâ€™s only half the story. Â  Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.Â  Â  This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself. *This audiobook includes a downloadable PDF of music credits. $34.00$29.95 The Dark Hours Michael Connelly â€œA masterpieceâ€?â€”LAPD detective RenÃ©e Ballard must join forces with Harry Bosch to find justice in a city scarred by fear and social unrest after a methodical killerÂ strikes on New Yearâ€™s Eve (Publishers Weekly). Thereâ€™s chaos in Hollywood at the end of the New Yearâ€™s Eve countdown. Working her graveyard shift, LAPD detective RenÃ©e Ballard waits out the traditional rain of lead as hundreds of revelers shoot their guns into the air. Only minutes after midnight, Ballard is called to a scene where a hardworking auto shop owner has been fatally hit by a bullet in the middle of a crowded street party. Â  Ballard quickly determines that the deadly bullet could not have fallen from the sky and that it is linked to another unsolved murderâ€”a case at one time worked by Detective Harry Bosch. At the same time, Ballard hunts a fiendish pair of serial rapists, the Midnight Men, who have been terrorizing women and leaving no trace. Â  Determined to solve both cases, Ballard feels like she is constantly running uphill in a police department indelibly changed by the pandemic and recent social unrest. It is a department so hampered by inertia and low morale that Ballard must go outside to the one detective she can count on: Harry Bosch. But as the two inexorable detectives work together to find out where old and new cases intersect, they must constantly look over their shoulders. The brutal predators they are tracking are ready to kill to keep their secrets hidden. Â  Unfolding with unstoppable drive and nail-biting intrigue, The Dark Hours shows that â€œrelentless on their own, Ballardâ€™s and Boschâ€™s combined skillsâ€¦could be combustibleâ€?

Features excerpts from five never before heard demos performed by Dave Grohl and an original story exclusive to The Storyteller audiobook. So, I've written a book. Having entertained the idea for years, and even offered a few questionable opportunities ("It's a piece of cake! Just do four hours of interviews, find someone else to write it, put your face on the cover, and voila!") I have decided to tell these stories just as I have always done, in my own voice. The joy that I have felt from chronicling these tales is not unlike listening back to a song that I've recorded and can't wait to share with the world, or reading a primitive journal entry from a stained notebook, or even hearing my voice bounce between the Kiss posters on my wall as a child.Â  This certainly doesn't mean that I'm quitting my day job, but it does give me a place to shed a little light on what it's like to be a kid from Springfield, Virginia, walking through life while living out the crazy dreams I had as young musician. From hitting the road with Scream at 18 years old, to my time in Nirvana and the Foo Fighters, jamming with Iggy Pop or playing at the Academy Awards or dancing with AC/DC and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, drumming for Tom Petty or meeting Sir Paul McCartney at Royal Albert Hall, bedtime stories with Joan Jett or a chance meeting with Little Richard, to flying halfway around the world for one epic night with my daughters...the list goes on. I look forward to focusing the lens through which I see these memories a little sharper for you with much excitement.Â  $34.99$26.95 Â©2021 GoogleSite Terms of ServicePrivacyDevelopersAbout Google|Location: CanadaLanguage: English (United States) By purchasing this item, you are transacting with Google Payments and agreeing to the Google Payments Terms of Service and Privacy Notice.
