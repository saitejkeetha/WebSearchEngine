As per my experience good interviewers hardly plan to ask any particular question during your interview, normally questions start with some basic concept of the subject and later they continue based on further discussion and what you answer ? What are the key responsibilities of SAP Basis Administrator? The key responsibilities are ? System installation and configuration. Load balancing on servers. Performance management of different components. Managing interfaces and integration with servers. Managing servers and different services. What is the current version of SAP GUI? How do you install it? SAP GUI 7.4, the latest version for Windows was released in October, 2014. It supports various features like â€” it is by default installed with NWBC 5.0 and SAP GUI and GUI shortcuts are launched through NWBC. Which SAP GUI type is suitable for different kind of users? How do you decide? When users are working mostly in the SAP system SAP GUI for Windows or SAP GUI for Java is recommended. When users are ABAP developers For ABAP developers, SAP GUI for Windows is recommended. When users use operating systems other than Microsoft It is recommended that they use SAP GUI for Java and HTML or they can use SAP GUI for Windows on a remote server For integrating Dynpro transactions to the Portal The use of SAP GUI for HTML is recommended. This allows you to integrate classic Dynpro-based applications into the portal easily. How do you maintain roles in the SAP system? To maintain roles in the SAP system, we use transaction code â€” PFCG Why do we create instances in SAP system? How are these instances configured? SAP instance is defined when you install and configure a SAP system. These are used to refer to memory, processors and other resources in the system. SAP instance allows users to login to the SAP system and share the same resources. A SAP instance is managed by CCMS and is used by users to login. A SAP system can consist of one or more instances â€” you can set up a SAP system with a single instance with only one CCMS or you can configure a system with two or more separate instances in client/server environment. We need to consider the following points to configure a SAP instance ? You need to define separate directories for UNIX, AS/400, or Microsoft Windows NT server on which the instance is to be run. You can use a shared file system. For each instance, there are entries created in operating system configuration files (/etc/services, /etc/sapconfigâ€¦). Explain the architecture of SAP system with different layers. What is the use of Gateway? Presentation layer communicates with the application server to perform all the processing. This is known as the brain of a SAP system. An application server consists of multiple instances and communicates with the database layer of the three-tier architecture. Bottom layer is called the database layer. This is responsible to store all the data. Database of SAP system is kept on a separate server for performance and security reason. The Presentation layer consists of different components for ABAP and JAVA that enables the communication and processing of data in SAP system. The key components at Presentation layer also includes â€” Gateway. This is used to manage communication between SAP system and external systems. Suppose you have to integrate SAP ECC 6.0 to AWS cloud. How can you achieve this? You have to make use of SAP Cloud Appliance Library (CAL). This will help you to directly push SAP ECC software to your cloud environment by entering the Security key. How do you check the installed software components and product versions on SAP system? Go to SAP system data ? Click on component magnifying glass. The following two options will be displayed ? Installed Software Component Versions Installed Product Versions Under installed software component, you can see all the software installed, support package, service pack, description etc. If you want to check the details of each component, you can select the component and go to the details tab as shown above. Go to Installed Product Versions; it will show you the version of the installed SAP NetWeaver. What is client administration in SAP system? Why do we use multiple clients in SAP system? A client is used in SAP system for multiple login on a single instance. You can create multiple clients on a single instance. It also provides data security as one user with one client canâ€™t see the data of the other user with another client and also there is no need to install the software again. The following are the advantages of client administration in SAP system ? Using SAP Clients, the same resources can be shared between multiple users. It helps you to manage SAP system landscape as you can create multiple clients for DEV, QA and PROD team. It allows you to share the SAP system with a large number of users. We have standard clients in SAP system What are the default clients in SAP system? How can you create a new client in SAP system? SAP system comes with the following three standard clients ? 000 ? This is called the master client and is available when you install R/3 system. 001 ? This is a copy of 000 and it comes with a test company. Generally, this client is used to create new clients. 066 ? This is called the SAP Early watch. This is used for diagnostic scans and monitoring service in the SAP system. Following are the steps to create a New Client in SAP ? To create a new client in SAP system, use transaction code â€” SCC4 To create a new client, enter the following details after clicking on New Entries ? Client number and name City Currency, Roles Enter your client-specific data and set permission for the clients as per your requirement and click on save. How can you create a new user in SAP system? How do you assign roles to new users? You can create multiple users with different access rights in SAP system. Follow these steps to create a new user ? Step 1 ? Use transaction code â€” SU01 Step 2 ? Enter the username you want to create, click on the Create icon. Step 3 ? You will be redirected to the Next Tab â€” the Address tab wherein, you have to enter details like First name, Last name, Phone number, email id, etc. Step 4 ? You will further be directed to another Tab â€” the Logon Data tab wherein, You have to enter the user type under Logon data tab. Type the first login password â€“ New Password and Repeat Password Step 5 ? You will now be directed to the Roles tab wherein, you have to assign the roles to the user Step 6 ? Now, the next tab is the Profiles tab wherein, you have to assign the Profiles to user. Step 7 ?Click on Save and you will get a confirmation. What are the different user types in SAP system that an admin can use while creating a new user? The following are the five different types of user types ? Dialog user â€” This user is used for interactive system access from GUI. System user â€” This user is used for background processing and communication within a system. Communication user â€” This user is used for external RFC calls. Service user â€” This user is created for a larger and anonymous group of users. Reference user â€” These are reference users with no logon possible, non-person related users that allow the assignment of additional authorizations. Is it possible to lock users in SAP system? What are the different ways to lock/unlock users? The different ways to lock/unlock users are ? Manually/Forcefully Automatically Manually or Forcefully You can lock a user forcefully/automatically using the following transaction codes ? Transaction- SU01 for single user Transaction â€“SU10 for multiple users How can you define login policy for users in SAP system? You can set the number of incorrect login attempts and then system can end the session or can also lock the user account if parameter value is set by Administrator. There are two types of parameters used ? Static ? This parameter doesnâ€™t apply immediately and the system needs a Restart for this. Dynamic ? This parameter can be applied directly and the system does not need a Restart. To set the value of parameters, use transaction code â€” RZ11s What are the different login and password parameters that can be applied in SAP system? To set the number of failed attempts, use parameter â€” login/fails_to_session_end. Likewise, you have other parameters such as login/fails_to_session_end, login/fails_to_user_lock The following are the password policy parameters ? login/min_password_lng login/password_expiration_time How do you maintain password selection for users? What are the different parameters that can be used for this and which table maintains these details? Passwords are maintained in table USR40 and transaction code â€” SM30 is used for this purpose. There are two wildcard characters ? ?- stands for a single character *- stands for a sequence of any combination characters of any length. If you select 123* in table USR40, it means that any password that begins with the sequence "123." is prohibited. If you enter *123*, it prohibits any password that contains the sequence "123." If you select AB?, it indicates that all passwords that begin with "AB" and an additional character are not allowed. For example, "ABB", "ABF", etc. What are the categories to execute SAP Background jobs? Class A (High Priority) ? This is used for urgent or critical tasks. These tasks must be scheduled with class A priority job. Class A job reserves one or more background work processes. Class B (Medium Priority) ? These jobs are executed after the completion of Class A high priority jobs. Class C (Low Priority) ? These jobs run once class A and class B jobs are completed. What are the different options available for scheduling a background job? What start conditions type can be used? To schedule a background job you must specify the conditions that will trigger the job to start. The different types of start condition you want to use are ? Immediate Date/Time After Job After Event At Operation Mode What are the different types of job status? Can you unschedule an active job? The different types of status are - Scheduled, Released, Ready, Active, Finished, Cancelled You canâ€™t unschedule a job if it is active. You need to wait for the completion of the job to unscheduled it. What is the use of commit value while deleting jobs in SAP system? Commit value is proportional to program performance. If the commit value is high, then job deletion will run faster. Recommended value is >= 1000. In Transport Management System (TMS), which file is used to store TMS configuration and is used by domains for checking configuration? DOMAIN.CFG file is created under usr/sap/trans/bin directory which stores TMS configuration and is used by systems and domains for checking existing configurations. What is a Transport Request in TMS? What are the different types of Transport Requests that can be created in a SAP system? A Transport Request contains number of changes to be implemented in the development system. It consists of the type of change, purpose, change category, target system and other details. Transport Requests are named in a standard format â€” <SID>K<Number> For example, in <SID>K<Number> ? SID represents System ID K stands for fixed keyword/alphabet Number can be anything from a range starting with 900001 There are two type of request types that can be created in SAP system ? Workbench Request ? This request type contains repository and cross-client customizing objects. Workbench requests are used to make changes to the ABAP workbench objects. Customizing Request ? This request type contains objects that belong to client-specific customizing. These requests are created in system automatically when a user performs customize setting and a target system is automatically assigned as per the transport layer. What is the use of transport logs in TMS system? What are the different log types and record value in the log files? There are two types of logs that are available in Transport Management System Transport Logs ? This keeps track of transport log files which have been moved in a transport request. Action Log ?

Batch Jobs monitoring Batch Jobs monitoring Monitoring Application Users Spool Request Monitoring Print Requests To monitor SAP system, use Transaction SM51 What is RFC connection? To communicate between SAP systems, there is a need to define a mechanism. One of the most common way is to define Remote function Call RFC connection between two systems. By creating a trusted RFC connection between two, it allows you to create trusted-trusting relationship between systems and you can communicate and exchange information and data. What are the different types of Trusted RFC connections in SAP system? Type 3 This connection type is used to specify connection between ABAP systems. As mentioned in next article, you need to mention host name and IP address of source system and also the logon information. This is applicable for both type of RFCs, between ABAP systems and external calls to ABAP systems. Type I It is used to specify ABAP systems connected to the same data base as the current system. Type T It is defined as connection for destinations to external programs that use the RFC API to receive RFCs. This can be activated using start or registration. How do you create Trusted RFC connection in ABAP system, Explain? Creating a Trusted RFC Connection ? On your source SAP system AA1 you want to setup a trusted RFC towards target system BB1. When it is done it would mean that when you are logged onto AA1 and your user has enough authorization in BB1, you can use the RFC connection and logon to BB1 without having to re-enter user and password. Using RFC trusted/trusting relationship between two SAP systems, RFC from a trusted system to a trusting system, password is no required for logging on to the trusting system. Open SAP ECC system using SAP logon. Enter transaction number sm59 ? this is transaction number to create a new Trusted RFC connection. What is Next? Further you can go through your past assignments you have done with the subject and make sure you are able to speak confidently on them. If you are fresher then interviewer does not expect you will answer very complex questions, rather you have to make your basics concepts very strong.
