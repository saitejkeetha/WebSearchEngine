Mock Test I Mock Test II Mock Test III Mock Test IV Hadoop Mock Test I Q 1 - The concept using multiple machines to process data stored in distributed system is not new.

B - Data Seek time is improving more slowly than data transfer rate. C - Data Seek time and data transfer rate are both increasing proportionately. D - Only the storage capacity is increasing without increase in data transfer rate. Answer : B Show Answer Q 6 - Data locality feature in Hadoop means A - store the same data across multiple nodes.

Answer : C Show Answer Q 7 - Which of these provides a Stream processing system used in Hadoop ecosystem? A - Solr B - Tez C - Spark D - Hive Answer : C Show Answer Q 8 - HDFS files are designed for A - Multiple writers and modifications at arbitrary offsets. B - Only append at the end of file C - Writing into a file only once. D - Low latency data access. Answer : B Show Answer Q 9 - A file in HDFS that is smaller than a single block size A - Cannot be stored in HDFS. B - Occupies the full block's size. C - Occupies only the size it needs and not the full block. D - Can span over multiple blocks. Answer : C Show Answer Q 10 - HDFS block size is larger as compared to the size of the disk blocks so that A - Only HDFS files can be stored in the disk used. B - The seek time is maximum C - Transfer of a large files made of multiple disk blocks is not possible. D - A single file larger than the disk size can be stored across many disks in the cluster. Answer : D Show Answer Q 11 - In a Hadoop cluster, what is true for a HDFS block that is no longer available due to disk corruption or machine failure? A - It is lost for ever B - It can be replicated form its alternative locations to other live machines. C - The namenode allows new client request to keep trying to read it. D - The Mapreduce job process runs ignoring the block and the data stored in it. Answer : B Show Answer Q 12 - Which utility is used for checking the health of a HDFS file system? A - fchk B - fsck C - fsch D - fcks Answer : B Show Answer Q 13 - Which command lists the blocks that make up each file in the filesystem. A - hdfs fsck / -files -blocks B - hdfs fsck / -blocks -files C - hdfs fchk / -blocks -files D - hdfs fchk / -files -blocks Answer : A Show Answer Q 14 - The datanode and namenode are respectiviley A - Master and worker nodes B - Worker and Master nodes C - Both are worker nodes D - None Answer : B Show Answer Q 15 - In the local disk of the namenode the files which are stored persistently are ? A - namespace image and edit log B - block locations and namespace image C - edit log and block locations D - Namespace image, edit log and block locations. Answer : A Show Answer Q 16 - When a client communicates with the HDFS file system, it needs to communicate with A - only the namenode B - only the data node C - both the namenode and datanode D - None of these Answer : C Show Answer Q 17 - What mechanisms Hadoop uses to make namenode resilient to failure. A - Take backup of filesystem metadata to a local disk and a remote NFS mount. B - Store the filesystem metadata in cloud. C - Use a machine with at least 12 CPUs D - Using expensive and reliable hardware. Answer : A Show Answer Q 18 - The main role of the secondary namenode is to A - Copy the filesystem metadata from primary namenode. B - Copy the filesystem metadata from NFS stored by primary namenode C - Monitor if the primary namenode is up and running. D - Periodically merge the namespace image with the edit log. Answer : D Show Answer Q 19 - For the frequently accessed HDFS files the blocks are cached in A - the memory of the datanode B - in the memory of the namenode C - Both A&B D - In the memory of the client application which requested the access to these files. Answer : A Show Answer Q 20 - User applications can instruct the namenode to cache the files by A - adding cache file names to cache pool B - adding cache config to cache pool C - adding cache directive to cache pool D - passing the file names as parameters to the cache pool Answer : C Show Answer Q 21 - In Hadoop 2.x release HDFS federation means A - Allowing namenodes to communicate with each other. B - Allow a cluster to scale by adding more datanodes under one namenode. C - Allow a cluster to scale by adding more namenodes. D - Adding more physical memory to both namenode and datanode. Answer : C Show Answer Q 22 - Under HDFS federation A - Each namenode manages metadata of the entire filesystem. B - Each namenode manages metadata of a portion of the filesystem. C - Failure of one namenode causes loss of some metadata availability from the entire filesystem. D - Each datanode registers with each namenode. Answer : B Show Answer Q 23 - The main goal of HDFS High availability is A - Faster creation of the replicas of primary namenode. B - To reduce the cycle time required to bring back a new primary namenode after existing primary fails. C - Prevent data loss due to failure of primary namenode. D - Prevent the primary namenode form becoming single point of failure. Answer : B Show Answer Q 24 - As part of the HDFS high availability a pair of primary namenodes are configured. What is true for them? A - When a client request comes, one of them chosen at random serves the request. B - One of them is active while the other one remains powered off.
