Q - Can I market my courses myself to increase my sell? Answer - Yes you can definitely do whatever markerting you can do at your level but for every sell your revenue share will remain same unlike other market places. This is because we also do require promotion of your course and we do not deduct any marketing charges from your sell like any other market places do. So we have flat revenue sharing regardless you sell it or we sell it. This is because we believe in win-win business where both the parties are putting same effort to sell the courses. Q - How much money I will earn by hosting my video courses at tutorialspoint.com? Answer - This depends on the course demand. If you have a great course which is very much in demand then you can have considerable number of sells per month. For every sell, we will share 55% revenue with the trainers which is far higher than what other marketplaces are offering. Please note that before sharing revenue for the sell we will have to deduct affiliation commission in case sell happens through any affilate, payment gateway charges and if sell happens in India then 18% GST (Goods & Services Tax) will also be deducted from the sell amount and then remaining amount will be shared between tutorials point and the owner of the course. Q - What prices should I keep for my course to sell at tutorialspoint.com? Answer - Your course price is your decision and you can keep it based on the value of your cost. However, we suggest to include your course in promotional activities where tutorials point will control the price of your course and will change time to time to give a boost to your sell. If you do not include a course in promotional activities then your base price (or discounted price if given) will be published as the selling price of the course. Q - How and when I will get my earned revenue from my courses sell? Answer - If you have your bank account in India then we will do direct bank to bank transfer of the finalized revenue otherwise we will do payment transfer using Paypal. Because every paid courses is sold with 30 days guarantee period so a sell will become mature only after 30 days if there is no refund was demanded by the customer and payment for this sell be delivered to the course owner in first week of the subsequent month after a sell becomes mature. Q - How my earned revenue will be paid in Dollars or Rupees? Answer - Right now we deal with only two currencies US Dollars and Indian Rupees. So our customers buy the courses using either US Dollar or Indian Rupees though our payment gatways (Paypal & CCAvenue) are capable enough to support any given currency. So if you are taking your payment in India then all total earned amount will be converted into Indian Rupees using Dollar to Rupees conversion rate given by the bank and finally it will be transfrered to your bank. But if you are asking your money transfer through Paypal then we will convert all the amount into US Dollars and will send it to you using Paypal. Kindly note that if you are taking your money throug Paypal then there will be some currency conversion and payment gateway charges applicable on the remittance.
