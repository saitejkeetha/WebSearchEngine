You will have to read all the given answers and click over the correct answer. If you are not sure about the answer then you can check the answer using Show Answer button. You can use Next Quiz button to check new set of questions in the quiz. Q 1 - What is the maximum size of a numeric field we can define in COBOL? A - 9(20) B - 9(18) C - 9(31) D - 9(10) Answer : B Explanation COBOL applications use 31 digit numeric fields. However, compiler only supports a maximum of 18 digits. So we use a maximum of 18 digits. Show Answer Q 2 - Where can we specify OCCURS clause? A - Elementary Item B - Group Item C - Both A & B D - None of these Answer : C Explanation In array declaration, we can specify occurs clause on Elementary item as well as on Group item also. Show Answer Q 3 - What is the position of Area B in COBOL program? A - 1-6 Columns B - 8-11 Columns C - 12-72 Columns D - 72-80 Columns Answer : C Explanation Area B start from 12 to 72 column. All COBOL statements must begin in area B. Show Answer Q 4 - Moving a Alphabetic field to Numeric is legal? A - Yes B - No Answer : B Explanation Moving a alphabetic field to numeric field is illegal in COBOL. It will throw error. Show Answer Q 5 - What is the output of following program?  IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. PROGRAM-ID. HELLO. DATA DIVISION. WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 01 WS-NUM1 PIC 9(9). 01 WS-NUM2 PIC 9(9). PROCEDURE DIVISION. A000-FIRST-PARA. MOVE 25 TO WS-NUM1 MOVE 15 TO WS-NUM2 IF WS-NUM1 > WS-NUM2 THEN DISPLAY 'IN LOOP 1 - IF BLOCK' ELSE DISPLAY 'IN LOOP 1 - ELSE BLOCK' END-IF. STOP RUN. A - IN LOOP 1 - ELSE BLOCK B - IN LOOP 1 - IF BLOCK C - Error D - None of these Answer : B Explanation WS-NUM1 is greater than WS-NUM2, so condition is satisfied and it will to IF loop. You can try same code using Try it option available below:  IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. PROGRAM-ID. HELLO. DATA DIVISION. WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 01 WS-NUM1 PIC 9(9). 01 WS-NUM2 PIC 9(9). PROCEDURE DIVISION. A000-FIRST-PARA. MOVE 25 TO WS-NUM1 MOVE 15 TO WS-NUM2 IF WS-NUM1 > WS-NUM2 THEN DISPLAY 'IN LOOP 1 - IF BLOCK' ELSE DISPLAY 'IN LOOP 1 - ELSE BLOCK' END-IF. STOP RUN. Show Answer Q 6 - What is the output of following program?  IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. PROGRAM-ID. HELLO. DATA DIVISION. WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 01 WS-CNT PIC 9(2) VALUE 0. 01 WS-STRING PIC X(15) VALUE 'AABCDACDAAEAAAF'. PROCEDURE DIVISION. INSPECT WS-STRING TALLYING WS-CNT FOR ALL 'A'. DISPLAY WS-CNT STOP RUN. A - 09 B - 06 C - 08 D - 10 Answer : C Explanation Inspect statement will count the number of 'A' in the string and will put the value in WS-CNT. You can try same code using Try it option available below:  IDENTIFICATION DIVISION. PROGRAM-ID. HELLO. DATA DIVISION. WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 01 WS-CNT PIC 9(2) VALUE 0. 01 WS-STRING PIC X(15) VALUE 'AABCDACDAAEAAAF'. PROCEDURE DIVISION. INSPECT WS-STRING TALLYING WS-CNT FOR ALL 'A'. DISPLAY WS-CNT STOP RUN. Show Answer Q 7 - Which command is used to place the cursor on a specific record? A - Open B - Start C - Read next D - Write Answer : B Explanation Start verb can be performed only on indexed and relative files. It is used to place the file pointer at a specific record. The access mode must be sequential or dynamic. File must be opened in I-O or Input mode. Show Answer Q 8 - Which of the following is not a figurative constant? A - High-Values B - Comma C - Zero D - Spaces Answer : B Explanation Comma is not a figurative constant. Figurative constants are constant values. Show Answer Q 9 - In which division we declare our variables? A - PROCEDURE DIVISION. B - IDENTIFICATION DIVISION C - DATA DIVISION D - ENVIRONMENT DIVISION Answer : C Explanation In Data Division we declare all the working storage variables. Show Answer Q 10 - Class condition is used to check if an operand contains only alphabets or numeric data. Spaces are considered in ALPHABETIC, ALPHABETIC-LOWER, and ALPHABETIC-UPPER. State whether true or false? A - False B - True Answer : B Explanation This statement is correct.
