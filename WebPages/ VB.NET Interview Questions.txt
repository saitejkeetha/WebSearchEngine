As per my experience good interviewers hardly plan to ask any particular question during your interview, normally questions start with some basic concept of the subject and later they continue based on further discussion and what you answer: What is VB.NET? Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) is an object-oriented computer programming language implemented on the .NET Framework. Although it is an evolution of classic Visual Basic language, it is not backwards-compatible with VB6, and any code written in the old version does not compile under VB.NET. What is entry point method of VB.NET program? Sub Main indicates the entry point of VB.Net program. What are Shared methods? Shared methods or static methods can be invoked without creating an object of the class. What are Shared variables? Shared declares a shared variable, which is not associated with any specific instance of a class or structure, rather available to all the instances of the class or structure. What are Shadows variable? Shadows indicate that the variable re-declares and hides an identically named element, or set of overloaded elements, in a base class. What are Static variable? Static indicates that the variable will retain its value, even when the after termination of the procedure in which it is declared. How to create a constant in VB.NET? In VB.Net, constants are declared using the Const statement. The Const statement is used at module, class, structure, procedure, or block level for use in place of literal values.

For generic type parameters, the Out keyword specifies that the type is covariant. What is the purpose of Overloads keyword in VB.NET? Overloads ? Specifies that a property or procedure redeclares one or more existing properties or procedures with the same name. What is the purpose of Overridable keyword in VB.NET? Overridable ? Specifies that a property or procedure can be overridden by an identically named property or procedure in a derived class. What is the purpose of Overrides keyword in VB.NET? Overrides ? Specifies that a property or procedure overrides an identically named property or procedure inherited from a base class. What is the purpose of ParamArray keyword in VB.NET? ParamArray ? ParamArray allows you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to the procedure. A ParamArray parameter is always declared using ByVal. What is the purpose of Partial keyword in VB.NET? Partial ?

The follwoing code shows declaring a jagged array named scores of Integers:  Dim scores As Integer()() = New Integer(5)(){} What is ArrayList in VB.NET? It represents ordered collection of an object that can be indexed individually. It is basically an alternative to an array. However, unlike array, you can add and remove items from a list at a specified position using an index and the array resizes itself automatically. It also allows dynamic memory allocation, add, search and sort items in the list. What is Hashtable in VB.NET? It uses a key to access the elements in the collection. A hash table is used when you need to access elements by using key, and you can identify a useful key value. Each item in the hash table has a key/value pair. The key is used to access the items in the collection. What is SortedList in VB.NET? It uses a key as well as an index to access the items in a list. A sorted list is a combination of an array and a hash table. It contains a list of items that can be accessed using a key or an index. If you access items using an index, it is an ArrayList, and if you access items using a key, it is a Hashtable. The collection of items is always sorted by the key value. What is Stack in VB.NET?

When you add an item in the list, it is called pushing the item, and when you remove it, it is called popping the item. What is Queue in VB.NET? It represents a first-in, first out collection of object. It is used when you need a first-in, first-out access of items. When you add an item in the list, it is called enqueue, and when you remove an item, it is called deque. What is BitArray in VB.NET? It represents an array of the binary representation using the values 1 and 0. It is used when you need to store the bits but do not know the number of bits in advance. You can access items from the BitArray collection by using an integer index, which starts from zero. In how many ways a function can return value in VB.NET? In VB.Net, a function can return a value to the calling code in two ways ? By using the return statement. By assigning the value to the function name. Can you create a function in VB.NET which can accept varying number of arguments? By using the params keyword, a method parameter can be specified which takes a variable number of arguments or even no argument. Can you pass additional type of parameters after using params in function definition? No! additional parameters are not permitted after the params keyword in a method declaration. Only one params keyword is allowed in a method declaration. Which class acts as a base class for all exceptions in VB.NET? VB.NET exceptions are represented by classes. The exception classes in VB.NET are mainly directly or indirectly derived from the System.Exception class. Some of the exception classes derived from the System.Exception class are the System.ApplicationException and System.SystemException classes. What is the difference between System.ApplicationException class and System.SystemException class? The System.ApplicationException class supports exceptions generated by application programs. Hence the exceptions defined by the programmers should derive from this class. The System.SystemException class is the base class for all predefined system exception. What is a stream in VB.NET? The stream is basically the sequence of bytes passing through the communication path. There are two main streams: the input stream and the output stream. The input stream is used for reading data from file (read operation) and the output stream is used for writing into the file (write operation). Which class in VB.NET helps in reading from, writing to and closing files? The FileStream class in the System.IO namespace helps in reading from, writing to and closing files. This class derives from the abstract class Stream. Briefly explain StreamReader class. The StreamReader class inherits from the abstract base class TextReader that represents a reader for reading series of characters. It is used for reading from text files. Briefly explain StreamWriter class. The StreamWriter class inherits from the abstract class TextWriter that represents a writer, which can write a series of character. It is used for writing to text files. Briefly explain BinaryReader class. The BinaryReader class is used to read binary data from a file. A BinaryReader object is created by passing a FileStream object to its constructor. The BinaryReader class is used for reading from a binary file. Briefly explain BinaryWriter class. The BinaryWriter class is used to write binary data to a stream. A BinaryWriter object is created by passing a FileStream object to its constructor. The BinaryWriter class is used for writing to a binary file. Explain usage of DirectoryInfo class. The DirectoryInfo class is derived from the FileSystemInfo class. It has various methods for creating, moving, and browsing through directories and subdirectories. This class cannot be inherited. Explain usage of FileInfo class. The FileInfo class is derived from the FileSystemInfo class. It has properties and instance methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening of files, and helps in the creation of FileStream objects. This class cannot be inherited. What are the components of a Visual Basic Control? Every Visual Basic control consists of three important elements ? Properties ? Describes the object. Methods ? Cause an object to do something. Events ? Happens when an object does something. What is the purpose of VB.NET Form control? It represents the container for all the controls that make up the user interface.
