Hard copy ? Output ? Purge B - Input ? Conversion ? Execution ? Hard copy ? Output ? Purge C - Input ? Conversion ? Execution ? Output ? Hard copy ? Purge D - None of these Answer : C Explanation Correct answer is C. Job is processed in this manner. Show Answer Q 9 - In Job processing, what happens in Input stage? A - Selection of Initiator for execution of Job B - Job statement is converted into an interpreted text to be understood by JES and stored into a dataset, which we call as SPOOL C - Job is taken as an input to JES D - Allocated resources and the JES SPOOL space is released Answer : C Explanation In input stage, Job is taken as an input to JES. Show Answer Q 10 - In Job processing, what happens in Conversion stage? A - Selection of Initiator for execution of Job B - Job statement is converted into an interpreted text to be understood by JES and stored into a dataset, which we call as SPOOL C - Job is taken as an input to JES D - Allocated resources and the JES SPOOL space is released Answer : B Explanation The JCL along with the PROC is converted into an interpreted text to be understood by JES and stored into a dataset, which we call as SPOOL. Show Answer Q 11 - In Job processing, what happens in Execution stage? A - Selection of Initiator for execution of Job B - Job statement is converted into an interpreted text to be understood by JES and stored into a dataset, which we call as SPOOL C - Job is taken as an input to JES D - Allocated resources and the JES SPOOL space is released Answer : A Explanation When the job reaches its highest priority, it is taken up for execution from the job queue. The JCL is read from the SPOOL, the program is executed and the output is redirected to the corresponding output destination as specified in the JCL. Show Answer Q 12 - What does JES stands for? A - Job Entry Schedule B - Job Entry Sub-system C - Job Entry System D - None of these Answer : C Explanation The Operating System uses Job Entry System (JES) to receive jobs into the Operating System, to schedule them for processing and to control the output. Show Answer Q 13 - In Job processing, what happens in Hard copy stage? A - Selection of Initiator for execution of Job B - Job statement is converted into an interpreted text to be understood by JES and stored into a dataset, which we call as SPOOL C - Moving the output of Job to spool output D - Allocated resources and the JES SPOOL space is released Answer : C Explanation In hard copy stage, output of job is moved to spool output. Show Answer Q 14 - In Job processing, what happens in Purge stage? A - Selection of Initiator for execution of Job B - Job statement is converted into an interpreted text to be understood by JES and stored into a dataset, which we call as SPOOL C - Moving the output of Job to spool output D - Allocated resources and the JES SPOOL space is released Answer : D Explanation When the job is complete, the allocated resources and the JES SPOOL space is released. In order to store the job log, we need to copy the job log to another dataset before it is released from the SPOOL. Show Answer Q 15 - What operation is performed by EXEC statement? A - Job Identification B - Execution of program C - Includes name of the dataset to operate D - None of these Answer : B Explanation Specifies the PROC/Program to be executed. In the above example, a SORT program is being executed (i.e., sorting the input data in a particular order). Show Answer Q 16 - What operation is performed by JOB statement? A - Job Identification B - Execution of program C - Includes name of the dataset to operate D - None of these Answer : A Explanation Specifies the information required for SPOOLing of the job such as job id, priority of execution, user-id to be notified upon completion of the job. Show Answer Q 17 - What operation is performed by DD statement? A - Job Identification B - Instruction for Execution C - Includes name of the dataset to operate D - None of these Answer : C Explanation DD statement is used to include name of the dataset to operate. Show Answer Q 18 - How do you code a Null statement? A - /* starting in column 1 B - //* starting in column 1 C - // starting in column 1 D - Blank line Answer : C Explanation JCL is terminated by a null statement which is optional. For a null statement code only // starting from column 1. All the lines after this will not be executed. Show Answer Q 19 - What is the purpose of coding CLASS parameter in job statement? A - Assign a job-class to a Job which decides the nature of job B - To specify the output destination for the system and Job messages when the job is complete C - To restart a job from a particular step D - To notify a user Answer : A Explanation Based on the time duration and the number of resources required by the job, companies assign different job classes. These can be visualized as individual schedulers used by the OS to receive the jobs. Placing the jobs in the right scheduler will aid in easy execution of the jobs. Some companies have different classes for jobs in test and production environment. Valid values for CLASS parameter are A to Z characters and 0 to 9 numeric (of length 1). Following is the syntax: CLASS=0 to 9 | A to Z Show Answer Q 20 - What is the purpose of coding MSGCLASS parameter in job statement?
