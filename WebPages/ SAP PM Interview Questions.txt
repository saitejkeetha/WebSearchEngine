As per my experience good interviewers hardly plan to ask any particular question during your interview, normally questions start with some basic concept of the subject and later they continue based on further discussion and what you answer ? What is SAP Plant Maintenance? SAP Plant Maintenance application component provides organization with a tool for all maintenance activities to be performed. All the activities that are performed under maintenance are interconnected and hence this module is closely integrated with other modules- Production Planning, Material Management, and Sales and Distribution. Which all modules you can integrate with SAP PM? This module is closely integrated with other modules- Production Planning, Material Management, and Sales and Distribution, Controlling, Customer Service. What are the key responsibilities in SAP Plant Maintenance? You perform the following activities under Plant Maintenance ? Inspection Inspection is done to check the actual condition of a technical system. Preventive Maintenance Preventive maintenance is used to maintain high availability of the technical system. It includes maintenance planning and work scheduling activities for technical objects. Repair Repair involves all measures that can be performed to restore the ideal condition. Repair process it is can be performed at many planning stages- like work scheduling, resource planning and initial costing, etc. and you can response immediately w.r.t to a damage events causing production shutdown. You can create required Purchase requisition, processed work orders to reduce the downtime. Explain the life cycle of SAP Plant Maintenance Notification process? Key Steps that are includes as part of Work Order Notification under SAP PM ? Notification Newly Created Work Order Creation of Purchase request for work orders Purchase Order created and parts Received Parts issues to Work Order Approval and Planning of Work Order Scheduling and Releasing Work Order Work Order Execution Closing a Work Order What is a Technical object in Plant Maintenance? To effectively manage SAP Maintenance activities in an organization, you need to divide existing maintenance structure into technical objects. Technical objects are used to define the machine types that exists in an organization and using the object characteristics, you can further define other technical objects. What is Maintenance Plant in Plant Maintenance? Maintenance plant for a technical object is known as plant in which you perform the maintenance tasks for the objects and planning is done. You can perform the following activities in Maintenance Planning Plant ? Defining Task list as per maintenance plan As per BOM in task list, you perform material planning. Management and scheduling of maintenance plans Maintenance Orders creation and execution What is Maintenance Planning? What are different types of Maintenance Planning? As per the structure of the company, maintenance planning can be performed. You define the tasks under maintenance planning as per the structure and defined technical objects. Following types of maintenance planning is possible ? Centralized Maintenance Planning Decentralize Maintenance Planning Partially Centralize Maintenance Planning What is different between Centralize and decentralize Maintenance Planning? Centralize Maintenance Planning Within an organization, centralize planning supports following structures ? There is only one plant for all the technical objects which is maintenance planning plant and maintenance plant. In other scenario, it is possible that a company has multiple maintenance plants and one plant is there in which maintenance planning is performed. All other plants has this plants as maintenance planning plant in which all activities are performed and this plant is indicated as maintenance planning plant in the system. As per above example ? Plants 001, 002 Maintenance Plants 001, 002 Maintenance Planning Plant 002 Plants assigned to maintenance planning plant 001 Decentralize Maintenance Planning In this scenario, company consists of multiple plants and each plant acts as its own maintenance planning plant and in SAP system all plants are mentioned as maintenance planning plant. Plants 001, 002 Maintenance Plants 001,002 Maintenance planning plants 001, 002 What do you understand by object related structuring of Technical Objects? In this structuring, you divide your technical system in to pieces known as equipment. An equipment is an individual object which can be placed in a technical system or part of technical system. What do you understand by Functional Structuring of Technical Objects? In this type of structure, you divide your technical system as per functional locations. With the division of product line into functional locations, individual unit can act as functional locations in the system. What is Equipment Master Record? An equipment is known as an individual object in the system that is maintained independently. Equipment can be installed at different functional locations. You can create individual equipment in an organization based on Object based structure of a technical system. What are the functions of using Equipment master? Using equipment you can perform following functions in the system ? You can manage individual data from a maintenance perspective in SAP system. You can perform individual maintenance tasks for each technical object in the system You can use this to maintain a record of all the maintenance tasks performed for a technical object. In case you want to see data for an object for a longer time, you can use equipment master record for the same. When to represent an object as Equipment or as Functional Location? In case of breakdown, you should represent an object as Technical Object if it is repaired. When you define an object as Technical object, you can maintain service history of the object in system. Note that you canâ€™t change the equipment number once it is created in the system. If you have entered an incorrect number mistakenly you need to achieve this to change it. When you are using multiple piece of equipment you need to classify the equipment to perform a qick search. When you exchange an object in case of breakdown due to its low value and in this case you donâ€™t need to maintain service history. For each functional location, you have to define a structure indicator as mentioned in previous topic. When you maintain a functional location in another functional location, you canâ€™t store the installation location history. When you mistakenly enter wrong master data for an equipment, how do you manage this? To make changes to equipment master record- There is possibility that data has been changed, or you mistakenly enter wrong data, and you have to change the master record. T-Code: IE02 What do you understand by data transfer between Technical Objects? It is possible to transfer master data from one functional location to other functional location or between functional location and piece of equipment. Using data transfer function, you can maintain data at superior level in hierarchical structure or you can also maintain data for objects assigned to functional locations. What do you understand by Horizontal and Hierarchical data transfer? Hierarchical data transfer In Hierarchical structure, you can maintain data at high level and system will automatically transfer the changes to below level. Horizontal data transfer Using horizontal data transfer, you can transfer data from reference location to functional location or from functional location to piece of equipment. What is a Milestone Confirmation? The milestone confirmation is a special form of confirmation, in which the confirmation of one operation causes other operations or sub operations to be automatically confirmed at the same time. Milestones are operations that have the corresponding indicator in the control key. Operations can be defined as milestone operations in their control keys. If a milestone operation is confirmed, then previous operations are automatically confirmed. Can we change Equipment category once defined? Yes, T-Code: IE02 Explain the use of use of item number in maintenance order? Item number is used to identify the material component that is to be used for an operation in the maintenance order. It is generally given in increments of 0010.It is the first field in the Components tab of a maintenance order. What is Breakdown Maintenance? In SAP PM, when there is a malfunction occurs for any of the equipment which requires a response from Maintenance team. The process of correcting this situation is known as Breakdown maintenance. When do you perform Breakdown Maintenance? Breakdown maintenance, it is required in following situations ? In breakdown maintenance, equipment is not working properly. In breakdown maintenance, production is effected when a technical equipment went breakdown. What is the order type for Breakdown Maintenance? PM02 What is Corrective Maintenance? The corrective maintenance contains all the process steps that are involved in preventive maintenance and regular maintenance process. Using corrective maintenance, following functions can be performed under Plant Maintenance ? Plant Maintenance user can enter a notification in SAP System to request maintenance and to repair defective equipment. Maintenance planner can create, plan, and schedule a maintenance work order in the system. Work order is received by the technician and enter the information. An authorized person in PM system approves and completes the work as per the work order. What is difference between Corrective Maintenance and Preventive Maintenance? In Preventive maintenance, routine checks are performed as per companyâ€™s maintenance strategy to ensure that machines are running as per the required parameters. In SAP PM, using routine maintenance plans you create a preventive work order. In Corrective Maintenance, you correct a malfunction or a machine failure by raising a notification in the system. Work order is received by the technician and enter the information. An authorized person in PM system approves and completes the work as per the work order. In certain scenarios, a corrective work order is created as a result of preventive work order when a routine checkup is performed, technician finds a failure or a malfunction in operating machine and a corrective work order is created to clear the fault. What is order type for Preventive Maintenance? PM03 is for performing Preventive maintenance. How is Corrective maintenance different from Breakdown maintenance? You perform a Corrective maintenance to improve the working condition of the machine. It is performed when a malfunction is detected and machine is not operating properly as per designated function. Breakdown maintenance is carried out when your equipment has a breakdown and not working. In Breakdown maintenance, production is affected. In SAP system PM02 order type is used to perform Breakdown Maintenance. What is Preventive Maintenance and key submodules under this? Preventive Maintenance in an organization is used to avoid system breakdown and to avoid production breakdown. Using Preventive maintenance, you can achieve various benefits in your company. Preventive maintenance term is used to perform inspections, preventive maintenance and repairs. Maintenance plans are used to define dates and the extent of preventive and inspection maintenance tasks which can be planned for technical objects. What is the task list in Preventive Maintenance? Task list in Preventive Maintenance is defined as the sequence of activities that are performed as part of Preventive Maintenance in an organization. They are used to perform repeated tasks as part of Preventive Maintenance and to perform them efficiently. Using Task lists, you can reduce the effort by standardizing the work sequence. All the updates are performed at one specific spot in the corresponding maintenance task list and all the maintenance orders and maintenance items in the system receive the updated status of work sequences. With help of task lists, it helps in reducing the effort required to create maintenance Orders and maintenance Items as you can refer back to Task list to see the work sequences. What is Planned Maintenance? All the schedule activities include inspection, maintenance and repairs come under Planned Maintenance. In Plant Maintenance, you define the time intervals when the work steps has to be executed and work sequences in which they have to be executed. What is an Ongoing Maintenance? Task list for ongoing maintenance contains the work sequences based on current inspection. All inspection that is done without a regular schedule comes under ongoing maintenance. What are different components under Maintenance Planning? Maintenance planning component is integrated with different components of other modules and subcomponent in Plant Maintenance ? Maintenance task lists Maintenance orders Maintenance notifications Work Clearance Management What is the Maintenance Plan? Different type of Maintenance Plans? Maintenance plan defines the schedule and list of tasks to be performed under Maintenance Planning. A Maintenance plan can be created as per companyâ€™ work like different objects can be maintained on different dates and scope can be different as per the object type. Following procedures can be used to create Preventive Maintenance Plan ? Single Cycle Plan Strategy Plan Multiple Counter plan Maintenance plan for service procurement Maintenance plan for an outline agreement Is Maintenance strategy mandate for Maintenance Plans? No Which Maintenance plan type is suitable for performing annul service of a car? Single cycle maintenance plan is used to define exactly one time-based or performance-based maintenance cycle, in which you specify the interval at which the maintenance plan should be executed. It is one of the simplest maintenance plan used for Maintenance planning. Example A single cycle maintenance plan- annual maintenance of a car or service of a Printer after 1 million copies. What is multiple counter maintenance plan? A multiple counter plan can be created without a maintenance strategy and is used for performance based maintenance. In the multiple counter plan you create maintenance cycles and allocate counters of equipment or functional locations with different dimensions to them. In live scenarios, you use multiple counter plan for the individual activities or for the individual groups of activities. Where do we use multiple counter maintenance plans? Explain with an example? A multiple counter plan can be created without a maintenance strategy and is used for performance based maintenance. In the multiple counter plan you create maintenance cycles and allocate counters of equipment or functional locations with different dimensions to them. In live scenarios, you use multiple counter plan for the individual activities or for the individual groups of activities. Example Multiple Counter plan is suited for the airline industry. You can capture where dimensions like inspections of the landing gear should depend on the number of kilometers flown and the number of take-offs, etc. Which maintenance plan is suitable for managing outline service agreement and what call objects are required? Using Maintenance plan with outline agreement, it allows you to simplify the processing of services as per the outline agreement for different objects. When you create a maintenance plan with an outline agreement, following maintenance call objects are created ? Service Notification Service Order What is Equipment category for Laboratory equipment in PM? Eqiup. Category Q How do you create Activity type in Plant Maintenance?
