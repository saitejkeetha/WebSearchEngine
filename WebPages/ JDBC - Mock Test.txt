Answer : C Explanation JDBC DriverManager is a class that manages a list of database drivers. It matches connection requests from the java application with the proper database driver using communication subprotocol. Show Answer Q 7 - Which of the following is correct about driver interface of JDBC? A - JDBC driver is an interface enabling a Java application to interact with a database. B - The JDBC driver gives out the connection to the database and implements the protocol for transferring the query and result between client and database. C - Both of the above. D - none of the above. Answer : C Explanation JDBC driver is an interface enabling a Java application to interact with a database. To connect with individual databases, JDBC requires drivers for each database. The JDBC driver gives out the connection to the database and implements the protocol for transferring the query and result between client and database. Show Answer Q 8 - Which of the following is correct about Connection interface of JDBC? A - Connection interface consists of methods for contacting a database. B - It represents communication context. C - Both of the above. D - none of the above. Answer : C Explanation Connection interface consists of methods for contacting a database. The connection object represents communication context. Show Answer Q 9 - Which of the following is correct about Statement class of JDBC? A - Statement encapsulates an SQL statement which is passed to the database to be parsed and compiled. B - Statement encapsulates an SQL statement which is passed to the database to be planned and executed. C - Both of the above. D - none of the above. Answer : C Explanation Statement encapsulates an SQL statement which is passed to the database to be parsed, compiled, planned and executed. Show Answer Q 10 - Which of the following is correct about ResultSet class of JDBC? A - ResultSet holds data retrieved from a database after you execute an SQL query using Statement objects. B - It acts as an iterator to allow you to move through its data. C - The java.sql.ResultSet interface represents the result set of a database query. D - All of the above. Answer : D Explanation ResultSet objects hold data retrieved from a database after you execute an SQL query using Statement objects. It acts as an iterator to allow you to move through its data. The java.sql.ResultSet interface represents the result set of a database query. Show Answer Q 11 - Which of the following manages a list of database drivers in JDBC? A - DriverManager B - JDBC driver C - Connection D - Statement Answer : A Explanation DriverManager class manages a list of database drivers in JDBC. Show Answer Q 12 - Which of the following gives out the connection to the database and implements the protocol for transferring the query and result between client and database? A - DriverManager B - JDBC driver C - Connection D - Statement Answer : B Explanation JDBC driver gives out the connection to the database and implements the protocol for transferring the query and result between client and database. Show Answer Q 13 - Which of the following consists of methods for contacting a database? A - DriverManager B - JDBC driver C - Connection D - Statement Answer : C Explanation Connection consists of methods for contacting a database. Show Answer Q 14 - Which of the following encapsulates an SQL statement which is passed to the database to be parsed, compiled, planned and executed? A - DriverManager B - JDBC driver C - Connection D - Statement Answer : D Explanation Statement encapsulates an SQL statement which is passed to the database to be parsed, compiled, planned and executed. Show Answer Q 15 - Which of the following holds data retrieved from a database after you execute an SQL query using Statement objects? A - ResultSet B - JDBC driver C - Connection D - Statement Answer : A Explanation ResultSet holds data retrieved from a database after you execute an SQL query using Statement objects. Show Answer Q 16 - Which of the following is not a valid type of ResultSet? A - ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY B - ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE C - ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE D - ResultSet.TYPE_BACKWARD_ONLY Answer : D Explanation ResultSet.TYPE_BACKWARD_ONLY is not a valid type of ResultSet.
