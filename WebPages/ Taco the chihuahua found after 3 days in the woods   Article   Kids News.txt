The 11-year-old was finally going to be reunited with her lost dog, Taco, after three days. Temperatures hovered around –6 C in Fort McMurray, Alberta, when the pet chihuahua went missing on Nov. 9. It took another dog, named Willow, to find Taco on top of a snowbank in the woods, over a kilometre away from home. Willow herself had also been lost before. And this isn't the first dog Willow has helped find. Willow and her owner, Graham Whatmough, left, reunited Taco with Ellyse Naughton, right, and her family. (Image submitted by Erin Naughton) What happened? Taco got out of his harness and ran away while on a walk with Ellyse’s dad and her brother in their neighbourhood. Ellyse said she screamed and cried after hearing the three-year-old dog had disappeared. “I couldn’t believe it,” she said. Her family handed out flyers, drove around multiple neighbourhoods and made Facebook posts asking for help. The rescue Willow’s owner, Graham Whatmough, saw the Facebook post about Taco’s disappearance on Nov. 12. He recognized the wooded area because Willow had helped him find a lost dog there last February. When they got to the familiar spot, Whatmough let Willow off her leash to go looking.

What's next? As tough as Taco was for surviving three days away from home, he’s become physically weak. Ellyse said he had lost nearly a kilogram in the time he went missing and now gets nervous outside. But she said he is eating a lot and recovering nicely, so things are looking up for Taco. How this pig and cat became BFFs Willow received a steak dinner for helping find Taco. Thanks to her service, Whatmough is considering getting her properly trained so she can save more dogs in the future. Have more questions? ?We'll look into it for you. Email us at cbckidsnews@cbc.ca.
