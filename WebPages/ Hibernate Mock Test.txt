Show Answer Q 12 - Which of the following is true about configuration component of Hibernate? A - The Configuration object is the first Hibernate object you create in any Hibernate application. B - The Configuration object is usually created only once during application initialization. C - The Configuration object represents a configuration or properties file required by the Hibernate. D - All of the above. Answer : D Explaination The Configuration object is the first Hibernate object you create in any Hibernate application and usually created only once during application initialization. It represents a configuration or properties file required by the Hibernate. Show Answer Q 13 - Which of the following object is used to create SessionFactory object in hibernate? A - Configuration B - Session C - SessionFactory D - Transaction Answer : A Explaination Configuration object is used to create a SessionFactory object. Show Answer Q 14 - Which of the following is true about SessionFactory object in hibernate? A - SessionFactory object configures Hibernate for the application using the supplied configuration file. B - SessionFactory object allows for a Session object to be instantiated. C - The SessionFactory is a thread safe object. D - All of the above. Answer : D Explaination SessionFactory object configures Hibernate for the application using the supplied configuration file and allows for a Session object to be instantiated. The SessionFactory is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application. Show Answer Q 15 - Which of the following is true about SessionFactory object in hibernate? A - The SessionFactory is heavyweight object. B - SessionFactory object is created during application start up and kept for later use. C - You would need one SessionFactory object per database using a separate configuration file. D - All of the above. Answer : D Explaination The SessionFactory is heavyweight object so usually it is created during application start up and kept for later use. You would need one SessionFactory object per database using a separate configuration file. So if you are using multiple databases then you would have to create multiple SessionFactory objects. Show Answer Q 16 - Which of the following is true about Session object in hibernate? A - A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. B - The Session object is lightweight. C - Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a Session object. D - All of the above. Answer : D Explaination A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database. Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a Session object. Show Answer Q 17 - Is SessionFactory a thread-safe object? A - true B - false Answer : A Explaination Yes, SessionFactory is a thread-safe and can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. Show Answer Q 18 - Is Session a thread-safe object? A - true B - false Answer : B Explaination No, Session is not thread-safe. Show Answer Q 19 - Which of the following is true about Transaction object in hibernate? A - A Transaction represents a unit of work with the database. B - Transactions in Hibernate are handled by an underlying transaction manager. C - This is an optional object and Hibernate applications may choose not to use this interface, instead managing transactions in their own application code. D - All of the above. Answer : D Explaination A Transaction represents a unit of work with the database and most of the RDBMS supports transaction functionality. Transactions in Hibernate are handled by an underlying transaction manager and transaction (from JDBC or JTA).This is an optional object and Hibernate applications may choose not to use this interface, instead managing transactions in their own application code. Show Answer Q 20 - Which of the following is true about Query object in hibernate? A - Query objects Hibernate Query Language (HQL) string to retrieve data from the database and create objects. B - Query objects SQL string to retrieve data from the database and create objects.

Answer : D Explaination Query objects use SQL or Hibernate Query Language (HQL) string to retrieve data from the database and create objects. A Query instance is used to bind query parameters, limit the number of results returned by the query, and finally to execute the query. Show Answer Q 21 - Which of the following is true about hibernate.dialect property in hibernate configuration? A - This property makes Hibernate generate the appropriate SQL for the chosen database.

Answer : A Explaination This property makes Hibernate generate the appropriate SQL for the chosen database. Show Answer Q 22 - Which of the following is true about transient state of a persistent entity? A - A new instance of a persistent class which is not associated with a Session.
