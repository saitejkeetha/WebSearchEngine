Answer : A Explanation Design patterns can be classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns. Show Answer Q 4 - Which of the following is correct about Creational design patterns. A - These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects. B - These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. C - These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities. D - None of the above. Answer : B Explanation Creational design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. Show Answer Q 5 - Which of the following is correct about Structural design patterns. A - These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

C - These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities. D - None of the above. Answer : C Explanation Structural design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities. Show Answer Q 6 - Which of the following is correct about Behavioral design patterns. A - These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects. B - These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. C - These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

Show Answer Q 7 - Which of the following is correct about Factory design pattern. A - This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern. B - Factory pattern creates object without exposing the creation logic to the client. C - Factory pattern refers to newly created object using a common interface. D - All of the above. Answer : D Explanation Factory pattern is one of most used design pattern in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface. Show Answer Q 8 - Which of the following is correct about Abstract Factory design pattern. A - This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern. B - Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. C - In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. D - All of the above. Answer : D Explanation Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern. Show Answer Q 9 - Which of the following is correct about Singleton design pattern. A - This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern. B - This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. C - Singleton class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class. D - All of the above. Answer : D Explanation Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class. Show Answer Q 10 - Can we create a clone of a singleton object? A - true B - false Answer : A Explanation true. It is possible to get a clone of singleton object. Throw exception within the body of clone() method to prevent cloning. Show Answer Q 11 - If we serialize a singleton object and deserialize it then the result object will be same. A - true B - false Answer : B Explanation false. Deserializing a serialized object will yield a different object. Show Answer Q 12 - Integer class is an example of Decorator pattern. A - true B - false Answer : A Explanation true. Wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean uses Decorator pattern. Show Answer Q 13 - Runtime class is an example of singleton. A - true B - false Answer : A Explanation true. Each java application uses Runtime as a single object. Show Answer Q 14 - Integer.valueOf is an example of Factory pattern. A - false B - true Answer : B Explanation true. Integer.valueOf() returns a Integer instance representing the specified int value. Show Answer Q 15 - Event handling frameworks like swing, awt use Observer Pattern. A - false B - true Answer : B Explanation true. Event handling frameworks like swing, awt use Observer Pattern. Show Answer Q 16 - Which of the following describes the Builder pattern correctly? A - This pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach. B - This pattern refers to creating duplicate object while keeping performance in mind. C - This pattern is used when creation of object directly is costly. D - This pattern is used when we need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Answer : A Explanation Builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach. This builder is independent of other objects. Show Answer Q 17 - Which of the following describes the Bridge pattern correctly? A - This pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach.
