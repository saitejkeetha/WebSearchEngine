As per my experience good interviewers hardly plan to ask any particular question during your interview, normally questions start with some basic concept of the subject and later they continue based on further discussion and what you answer ? What is Python? Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages. Name some of the features of Python. Following are some of the salient features of python ? It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP. It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications. It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking. It supports automatic garbage collection. It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java. What is the purpose of PYTHONPATH environment variable? PYTHONPATH - It has a role similar to PATH. This variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported into a program. It should include the Python source library directory and the directories containing Python source code. PYTHONPATH is sometimes preset by the Python installer. What is the purpose of PYTHONSTARTUP environment variable? PYTHONSTARTUP - It contains the path of an initialization file containing Python source code. It is executed every time you start the interpreter. It is named as .pythonrc.py in Unix and it contains commands that load utilities or modify PYTHONPATH. What is the purpose of PYTHONCASEOK environment variable? PYTHONCASEOK ? It is used in Windows to instruct Python to find the first case-insensitive match in an import statement. Set this variable to any value to activate it. What is the purpose of PYTHONHOME environment variable? PYTHONHOME ? It is an alternative module search path. It is usually embedded in the PYTHONSTARTUP or PYTHONPATH directories to make switching module libraries easy. Is python a case sensitive language? Yes! Python is a case sensitive programming language. What are the supported data types in Python? Python has five standard data types ? Numbers String List Tuple Dictionary What is the output of print str if str = 'Hello World!'? It will print complete string. Output would be Hello World!. What is the output of print str[0] if str = 'Hello World!'? It will print first character of the string. Output would be H. What is the output of print str[2:5] if str = 'Hello World!'? It will print characters starting from 3rd to 5th. Output would be llo. What is the output of print str[2:] if str = 'Hello World!'? It will print characters starting from 3rd character. Output would be llo World!. What is the output of print str * 2 if str = 'Hello World!'? It will print string two times. Output would be Hello World!Hello World!. What is the output of print str + "TEST" if str = 'Hello World!'? It will print concatenated string. Output would be Hello World!TEST. What is the output of print list if list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]? It will print complete list. Output would be ['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003].

What is the output of print tinylist * 2 if tinylist = [123, 'john']? It will print list two times. Output would be [123, 'john', 123, 'john']. What is the output of print list1 + list2, if list1 = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ] and ist2 = [123, 'john']? It will print concatenated lists. Output would be ['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.2, 123, 'john'] What are tuples in Python? A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses. What is the difference between tuples and lists in Python? The main differences between lists and tuples are ? Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists. What is the output of print tuple if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )? It will print complete tuple. Output would be ('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003). What is the output of print tuple[0] if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )? It will print first element of the tuple. Output would be abcd. What is the output of print tuple[1:3] if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )? It will print elements starting from 2nd till 3rd. Output would be (786, 2.23). What is the output of print tuple[2:] if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )? It will print elements starting from 3rd element. Output would be (2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003). What is the output of print tinytuple * 2 if tinytuple = (123, 'john')? It will print tuple two times. Output would be (123, 'john', 123, 'john'). What is the output of print tuple + tinytuple if tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ) and tinytuple = (123, 'john')? It will print concatenated tuples. Output would be ('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003, 123, 'john'). What are Python's dictionaries? Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type.

Write a function in python which detects whether the given two strings are anagrams or not.  def check(a,b): if(len(a)!=len(b)): return False else: if(sorted(list(a)) == sorted(list(b))): return True else: return False Name the python Library used for Machine learning. Scikit-learn python Library used for Machine learning What does pass operation do? Pass indicates that nothing is to be done i.e. it signifies a no operation. Name the tools which python uses to find bugs (if any). Pylint and pychecker. Write a function to give the sum of all the numbers in list? Sample list ? (100, 200, 300, 400, 0, 500) Expected output ? 1500 Program for sum of all the numbers in list is ?  def sum(numbers): total = 0 for num in numbers: total+=num print(''Sum of the numbers: '', total) sum((100, 200, 300, 400, 0, 500)) We define a function â€˜sumâ€™ with numbers as parameter. The in for loop we store the sum of all the values of list. Write a program in Python to reverse a string without using inbuilt function reverse string? Program to reverse a string in given below ?  def string_reverse(str1): rev_str = ' ' index = len(str1) #defining index as length of string. while(index>0): rev_str = rev_str + str1[index-1] index = index-1 return(rev_str) print(string_reverse('1tniop')) First we declare a variable to store the reverse string. Then using while loop and indexing of string (index is calculated by string length) we reverse the string. While loop starts when index is greater than zero. Index is reduced to value 1 each time. When index reaches zero we obtain the reverse of string. Write a program to test whether the number is in the defined range or not? Program is ?  def test_range(num): if num in range(0, 101): print(''%s is in range''%str(num)) else: print(''%s is not in range''%str(num)) Output ? test_range(101) 101 is not in the range To test any number in a particular range we make use of the method â€˜if..inâ€™ and else condition. Write a program to calculate number of upper case letters and number of lower case letters? Test on String: ''Tutorials POINT'' Program is ?  def string_test(s): a = { ''Lower_Case'':0 , ''Upper_Case'':0} #intiail count of lower and upper for ch in s: #for loop if(ch.islower()): #if-elif-else condition a[''Lower_Case''] = a[''Lower_Case''] + 1 elif(ch.isupper()): a[''Upper_Case''] = a [''Upper_Case''] + 1 else: pass print(''String in testing is: '',s) #printing the statements. print(''Number of Lower Case characters in String: '',a[''Lower_Case'']) print(''Number of Upper Case characters in String: '',a[''Upper_Case'']) Output ? string_test(''Tutorials POINT'') String in testing is: Tutorials POINT Number of Lower Case characters in String: 8 Number of Upper Case characters in String: 6 We make use of the methods .islower() and .isupper(). We initialise the count for lower and upper. Using if and else condition we calculate total number of lower and upper case characters. What is Next? Further you can go through your past assignments you have done with the subject and make sure you are able to speak confidently on them. If you are fresher then interviewer does not expect you will answer very complex questions, rather you have to make your basics concepts very strong. Second it really doesn't matter much if you could not answer few questions but it matters that whatever you answered, you must have answered with confidence. So just feel confident during your interview. We at tutorialspoint wish you best luck to have a good interviewer and all the very best for your future endeavor.
