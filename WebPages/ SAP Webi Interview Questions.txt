As per my experience good interviewers hardly plan to ask any particular question during your interview, normally questions start with some basic concept of the subject and later they continue based on further discussion and what you answer: What are the different versions of Business Objects that you have worked on? BO XI R1 BO XI R2 BO XI R3 BO XI R3.1 BO XI R3.2 In year 2011, BO XI 4.0 was introduced and latest version of the tool is SAP BO 4.2. What are the key differences between BOXI R3 and SAP BO 4.x? Deski is not available in BO 4.x IDT is introduced to support multiple data sources Import Wizard is no longer available in BO 4.x Bo 4.x is 6 layered architecture as compared to BOXI R3 5 layer architecture. How do you migrate Deski to Webi reports in Business Objects? Using Report Conversion Tool To publish a Webi report created on the top of Universe in BO repository, it should be created on which connection? Secured connection published to Repository What are the differences between Personal, Shared and Secured connections? A Personal connection is created by one user and cannot be used by other users. The connection details are stored in PDAC.LSI file. A shared connection can be used by other users through a shared server. The connection details are stored in SDAC.LSI file in the Business Objects installation folder. However one cannot set rights and securities on objects in a shared connection. Neither can a Universe to exported to repository using a shared connection. A secured connection overcomes these limitations. Through it rights can be set on objects and documents. Universes can be exported to the central repository only through a secured connection. The connection parameters in this case are saved in the CMS. What is BI Launchpad? BI Launchpad is a Java or HTML based interface of Business Objects tool to perform analytical reporting and data analysis. You can set the preference for your BI Launchpad which determines which tool interface is launched via Launchpad. Using Web or Internet Application to access WebI interface via BI Launchpad, you can perform the below tasks ? Create, edit and refresh all the reports in Web Intelligence. Create and edit all the queries in no data source (Universes) but not BEx queries in Web application. Explain the architecture of Web Intelligence tool? It is three layered architecture ? Database layer - This layer defines multiple SAP and non-SAP data sources. Semantic Layer - This layer defines multidimensional data model. Presentation Layer - This layer defines where data is presented to end users. Various data sources can be used to create analytical and ad-hoc reports What are the different application modes that can be used in a Web Intelligence tool? There are three different application modes that can be used to build the queries, create documents and to analyze the reports. When you open an existing reports below modes are available ? Data Application Mode Reading Design To add, delete objects in a report, applying conditional formatting, applying formulas in report, creating variables, you should open Webi document in which of the following mode? Design mode with Data What are the different data sources that you can use to create a new Webi document? Universe Flat files in .csv or .xls format BEx queries Analysis View What is the extension of a Webi document? .wid file You have few report created in older versions of Web Intelligence 3.1 and want to upgrade to 4.x, which tool you should use? Using Upgrade Management Tool UMT What is the extension of Universes created in Information Design Tool and UDT? .unx- File created with Information Design Tool .unv- File created in Universe Design Tool What is a Query panel? You can select from list of available objects as per your access permissions. You may not be able to use few of the objects cos of permission. In query panel, you have Universe outline in left pane and Result objects, query filters, data preview panels in main pane. Which connection you can use to import all OLAP functionalities from an InfoCube in SAP BW? BICS Business Intelligence Consumer Service. BICS connectivity is the recommended way for BI tools to connect to Business Explorer (BEx) queries on the SAP NetWeaver BW server. What are the different save as formats supported for a Webi report? WID PDF Excel Excel 2007 CSV Achieve TXT File What are classes and subclasses? Classes are used to group similar objects in a report. A class can contain one or more subclasses. Subclasses contains further subcategory of objects in upper level of a class. Classes are used to organize objects in some logical manner. While creating queries on Universe you can find the information on objects that you have to use in query. What is difference between members and named set in hierarchies? Members are defined at different level of hierarchies in a data source. Example Consider a Geography hierarchy contain members â€“ â€œIndiaâ€? at country level and â€œHaryanaâ€? at State level. You can also include individual members in query from hierarchy if you donâ€™t want to add all the members. Named set can be used to define set of members. A named set is defined as named expression and results a set of members. You can define named set at Universe level or a relational or OLAP database level. Where do you define hierarchies to use in Webi report? Universe level How do you use InfoCubes in SAP BW to connect to Webi document? You can create Webi documents based on BEx (business Exchange Queries) created by BEx Query Designer which is based on Info Cube in SAP BW system. You can connect to a BEx query in WebI with use of BICS BI consumer service connection. You need not to create Universe for BEx queries and all attributes, hierarchies, dimensions and measures are automatically mapped in WebI document. How do you connect to SQL server to create a Universe to use in a Webi report? Using a Relational connection created in Universe Designer What are the query filters? Query filters are used to limit the rows returned in a WebI document. Query filters allow you to hide the data that you donâ€™t want to show to specific people and also limit the size of .wid document. When you run a query, it only returns the rows that meet the query filter definition. Below are the key features used in Query filter ? You can retrieve data as per specific business requirement. You can hide the data that you donâ€™t want specific users to see in a WebI document. Limit the size of WebI document of network and hence provides performance optimization. Example ? Being an Area Sales Manager for NY, you want to see margin values for your region and Sales universe contains data from all the regions in United State. Also you only want to see data from the stores in NY where sales margin is greater than 100K USD in 2nd Quarter Q2 2015. What is difference between query and report filters? Query filters are applied in Query Panel and they are used to limit the number of rows from data sources and to return the same in document. Report filters are applied at report level on reports, tables, charts, etc. These filters are not used to limit the data retrieval from the data source and only hide certain values at report level. Why do we use Prompts? Where do we apply Prompts to use in Webi report? Prompt is defined as special filter for users which allows them to enter a value every time data is refreshed in the document. Using prompts, you have multiple users viewing one document to display different sub set of data in database. Prompts allow you to retrieve the data from database and reduce the time. Prompts are created in Query Panel What is context and how they are created? Context defines a particular join path between tables or a specific group of joins for a particular query. Any objects created on a table column which belong to specific contexts is naturally compatible with all other objects from same contexts. Contexts may be created using detect contexts feature or manually. They are generally created based on logical calculation and business requirements, hence the detect context method is not very effective. To manually create a context Go to Insert Context, give the context name and select the joins that should be present in the context. For a universe contexts should be created in a way that all joins(except shortcut joins) fall in at least one context. What is Aggregate awareness function? Why do we use it? Aggregate awareness function is used in scenarios where we have same fact tables in different grains. Using this function we can define only one object for the measures in the fact tables. aggregate_aware(highest_level,lower level) We also need to define dimensions for associated granularities and define their incompatibilities with the corresponding facts through the aggregate navigation. This is accesses through Tools ? Aggregate Navigation. Use They are used to enhance the performance reports by utilizing arrogate tables available at database and are applied at Universe level as function. What is the use of subquery? Subqueries provides you a more flexible option to filter the data as compared to an ordinary query filter. Using Subqueries you can limit the values returned with a WHERE clause. You can also compare the values of objects in a subquery with the other objects. Using Subqueries, you can implement complex logic to limit the size of data which are not possible to apply with simple query filters. They are used in Query panel. In Query panel, you canâ€™t see ranking option enabled, what could be the reason? Database ranking is done by editing the script generated by query. If you database doesnâ€™t support ranking, then option to create ranking will not highlight in query panel. Also note that Ranking canâ€™t be created on hierarchical data. What do you understand by hierarchical data? Hierarchical data is defined a data with Parent-child relationship and you can analyze the data at different levels of hierarchy. All the measures that are associated with hierarchical data are aggregated as per object level in hierarchy. Example Consider a Geography hierarchy, you have Country India and State defined as Delhi. Now if you use this geographical hierarchy in report and want to analyze Number of Units sold at each level for different categories, then hierarchies allow you to use Aggregation at country level and if you drill down to state level, for each state too. What is difference between Break and Sections? Section breakup the data into multiple cells that are called Section headers and Each Section header contains a value for dimension and data corresponding to dimension value. Break is used divides the data up into one block and each column carries dimension, attributes and measures and these values are repeated for each other row values in the block. What is query stripping? Query stripping feature optimizes the query to fetch only DATA which will be directly or indirectly rendered or displayed to the User, thus decreasing the response time and faster display of the report for the user. This feature is only available for OLAP universes, and it will be greyed out when using any RDBMS universe. It is used in Query panel. What are the different chart type in Webi tool? Bar Box Column Line Map Radar Pie Waterfall Explain the difference between Query filter, Report filter and block filter? A query filter limits the data returned from the database. A block filter allows selected data to display in a single block and hides the other data. A report filter allows selected data to display in a page and hides the other data. The report filter applies to all data blocks on the page. When you synchronize two queries from different data sources, what rules must you respect? Respect the following rules Object names can differ. The data type for the merged objects must be the same. Data must have the same case because the data provider is case-sensitive. You can only synchronize on dimensions. You can only display measures with synchronized dimensions. When you use them for another purpose, duplicate values appear. You use the MINUS operator to combine queries, what would be the result? All records that match the first query condition and not the second condition. What is the use of Conditional formatting in Webi report? Conditional Formatting is used to highlight some specific values in the report. If you want you can show specific low or high values with some specific colors. Conditional formatting can be applied to below elements ? Rows in horizon tables Columns in Vertical tables Cells in forms and cross tables Sections Free Holding Cells Condition formatting can be used to make these formatting changes ? Text Color Size and Style Cell Border Color Size and Style Cell backgrounds How you can add multiple query filters in Query panel? By using AND/OR operators What are the different Report filters operators? Equal To Not Equal To Different From Operator Greater Than Greater Than or Equal To Less Than Less Than or Equal To Between Not Between In List Not In List Is Null Is Not Null You want to use queries from different data sources in a Webi document. How you can use this? Using Query Merge. This option allows you to merge the data from different data sources. Assume that you have created Query 1 and Query 2 in Query Panel. When you combine both the queries in a single WebI report, objects from both the queries are shown in list of available objects. You want to add a new column in the report based on an existing fact value. How you can add this functionality? Using New Variable What is an input context? The input context is the list of dimensions that are included in the calculation itself. What is use of string concatenation? Lastname+ â€œ, â€œ + Firstname What is the use of Nofilter() function? To override a report filter or a ranking How do you create a hyperlink in the Web Intelligence Interactive panel? By using Create Hyperlink dialog box To allow sync between two queries in Query merger, you use a new variable to add it to report. What re properties that you need to define to enable sync? Enter the Variable name, Qualification as â€œDetailâ€? and it will add a new field Associate Dimension. In Associate dimension, select the unique object from the same query. How do you connect SAP HANA database to Webi document? To use HANA tables for report creation, Use Universe Designer to create Universe using a Relational connection to HANA database. Can you attach a Webi document in mail? Yes, by using send by email attachment option You have saved a Webi Report .wid file and send it to other user to make changes. He is not able to open it and getting access error. How you can resolve this? When you use Save as option, on right side you get many options â€“ Refresh on open, Permanent Regional formatting, Save for all users, Remove document Security. Select Save for all usersâ€™ option while saving the report. In a Webi report, you want to add Radio buttons for end users to quickly view and analyze the data. Which of the Webi feature support this? Input Controls What do you understand by input controls? Can we use input controls on Geography and Time hierarchy? Input controls are used to filter and analyze the report data. You define input controls using text boxes and radio buttons. Input controls are associated with report elements like tables and section headers and use control to apply filter on report elements. When you select a value of an input control, it filters the values in report element that is associated with input control by selected value. Input Controls can also be used on hierarchical data. What is Next ? Further you can go through your past assignments you have done with the subject and make sure you are able to speak confidently on them. If you are fresher then interviewer does not expect you will answer very complex questions, rather you have to make your basics concepts very strong. Second it really doesn't matter much if you could not answer few questions but it matters that whatever you answered, you must have answered with confidence. So just feel confident during your interview. We at tutorialspoint wish you best luck to have a good interviewer and all the very best for your future endeavor.
