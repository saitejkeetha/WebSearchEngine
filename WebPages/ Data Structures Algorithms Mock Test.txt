Mock Test I Mock Test II Mock Test III Mock Test IV Data Structures Algorithms Mock Test I Q 1 - What is the worst case time complexity of linear search algorithm? A - ?(1) B - ?(n) C - ?(log n) D - ?(n2) Answer : D Explanation Linear search scans sequentially to find the target value. The best case is ?(1) and average and worst case is ?(n). Worst case is when data is not in the list, and it has to scan all n elements. Show Answer Q 2 - What is the worst case run-time complexity of binary search algorithm? A - ?(n2) B - ?(nlog n) C - ?(n3) D - ?(n) Answer : D Explanation In the worst case, binary search will be left or right intended, making it compare all the n values. Show Answer Q 3 - Which of the following usees FIFO method A - Queue B - Stack C - Hash Table D - Binary Search Tree Answer : A Explanation Queue maintains two pointers ? front and rear. In queue data structure, the item inserted first will always be removed first, hence FIFO! Show Answer Q 4 - A complete graph can have A - n2 spanning trees B - nn - 2 spanning trees C - nn + 1 spanning trees D - nn spanning trees Answer : B Explanation At maximum, a complete graph can have nn - 1 spanning trees. Show Answer Q 5 - Which one of the below is not divide and conquer approach? A - Insertion Sort B - Merge Sort C - Shell Sort D - Heap Sort Answer : B Explanation Among the options, only Merge sort divides the list in sub-list, sorts and then merges them together Show Answer Q 6 - Prefix notation is alsow known as A - Reverse Polish Notation B - Reverse Notation C - Polish Reverse Notation D - Polish Notation Answer : D Explanation Polish Notation Show Answer Q 7 - In order traversal of binary search tree will produce ? A - unsorted list B - reverse of input C - sorted list D - none of the above Answer : C Explanation Binary search tree yields a sorted list when traversed in-order. Show Answer Q 8 - In a min-heap: A - parent nodes have values greater than or equal to their childs B - parent nodes have values less than or equal to their childs C - both statements are true D - both statements are wrong Answer : A Explanation In a min heap, parents always have lesser or equal values than that of their childs. Show Answer Q 9 - A procedure that calls itself is called A - illegal call B - reverse polish C - recursive D - none of the above Answer : C Explanation In recursion, a procedure calls itself, either directly or by calling a procedure which in turn calls it. Show Answer Q 10 - For a binary search algorithm to work, it is necessary that the array (list) must be A - sorted B - unsorted C - in a heap D - popped out of stack Answer : A Explanation As binary search divides the list and selects a the sub-list to extend search based on comparison of values, it becomes necessary that the array (list) must be in sorted form. Show Answer Q 11 - push() and pop() functions are found in A - queues B - lists C - stacks D - trees Answer : C Explanation Stack uses push() to insert an item in stack, and pop() to remove the top item from stack. Show Answer Q 12 - Queue data structure works on A - LIFO B - FIFO C - FILO D - none of the above Answer : B Explanation In queue, data item inserted first, will be available first and data item inserted last will be available in the last. FIFO stands for First In First Out and is a correct answer. Show Answer Q 13 - Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree with height k, where root is height 0, is A - 2k ? 1 B - 2k+1 ? 1 C - 2k-1 + 1 D - 2k ? 1 Answer : B Explanation If the root node is at height 0, then a binary tree can have at max 2k+1 ? 1 nodes. For example: a binary tree of height 1, can have maximum 21+1 ? 1 = 3 nodes.  r --------- 0 / \ L R --------- 1 Show Answer Q 14 - Which one of the below mentioned is linear data structure ? A - Queue B - Stack C - Arrays D - All of the above Answer : D Explanation All mentioned data structures are linear in nature. Show Answer Q 15 - What data structure is used for depth first traversal of a graph? A - queue B - stack C - list D - none of the above Answer : B Explanation Stack is used for depth first traversal whereas queue is used for breadth first traversal Show Answer Q 16 - What data structure is used for breadth first traversal of a graph? A - queue B - stack C - list D - none of the above Answer : A Explanation Queue is used for breadth first traversal whereas stack is used for depth first traversal. Show Answer Q 17 - What data structure can be used to check if a syntax has balanced paranthesis ? A - queue B - tree C - list D - stack Answer : D Explanation Stack uses LIFO method which is good for checking matching paranthesis. Show Answer Q 18 - Postfix expression is just a reverse of prefix expression. A - True B - False Answer : B Explanation Expression notations are not reverse (or so) of each other, rather operators used in the expression have different arrangements. Show Answer Q 19 - Stack is used for A - CPU Resource Allocation B - Breadth First Traversal C - Recursion D - None of the above Answer : C Explanation Recursive procedures use stacks to execute the result of last executed procedural call. Show Answer Q 20 - A circular linked list can be used for A - Stack B - Queue C - Both Stack & Queue D - Neither Stack or Queue Answer : C Explanation Both stack and queue data structure can be represented by circular linked-list. Show Answer Q 21 - A linked-list is a dynamic structure A - true B - false Answer : A Explanation A linked-list is dynamic structure, it can shrink and expand as required by the program. Show Answer Q 22 - Minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is A - 2n2 B - 2n-1 C - 2n - 1 D - 2n - 1 Answer : C Explanation Minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n - 1. Where n is the number of disks. If the number of disks is 3, then minimum number of moves required are 23 - 1 = 7 Show Answer Q 23 - Which of the following is an example of dynamic programming approach? A - Fibonacci Series B - Tower of Hanoi C - Dijkstra Shortest Path D - All of the above Answer : D Explanation All mentioned use dynamic programming approach. Before solving the in-hand sub-problem, dynamic algorithm will try to examine the results of previously solved sub-problems. The solutions of sub-problems are combined in order to achieve the best solution. Show Answer Q 24 - The following formula will produce  Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 A - Armstrong Number B - Fibonacci Series C - Euler Number D - Prime Number Answer : B Explanation Fibonacci Series generates subsequent number by adding two previous numbers. Show Answer Q 25 - Minimum number of queues required for priority queue implementation? A - 5 B - 4 C - 3 D - 2 Answer : D Explanation Minimum number of queues required for priority queue implementation is two. One for storing actual data and one for storing priorities.
