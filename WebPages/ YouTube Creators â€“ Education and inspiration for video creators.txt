From here you can either upload a video from your camera roll or create using our suite of lightweight tools. Help Your Videos Stand Out and Keep Viewers Watching Growing your channel is all about creating videos viewers want to watch and accurately presenting them to the audience. When doing so, here's a few tips to keep in mind. With each video, think carefully about the title, description and thumbnail you plan to use â€“ these should all accurately reflect your content and let viewers know what they can expect from the video. If you're a Shorts creator, think about how the first 1â€“2 seconds of your content can grab viewers scrolling through the video feed! Once you've got viewers watching, you can redirect their attention via hashtags, playlists, cards, end screens and more.

Read more about promoting your videos The Algorithm Our search and discovery systems are built to find videos that match viewers' individual interests. We recommend videos based on things such as: what your audience watches and doesn't watch, how much time they spend watching, what they like and dislike, if they mark a video as 'not interested' and on satisfaction surveys. So, rather than trying to find a secret code to these systems, focus instead on making videos that you think will resonate with your audience. A great tool here is YouTube Analytics, which provides data that can help you understand how your existing content is performing and provide insights for future videos! 01 How do I start creating on YouTube?
