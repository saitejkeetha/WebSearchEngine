As in the first half we are getting the node of value we want to skip and returning it so that we can pass it in our function deleteNode. If the node value is anywhere before the last element then the if condition will execute. Something to note here as we are not using head pointer, we cannot point to next address of our node because there is no previous node. So we are assigning next node data to the current node and storing ...the second node address from our current node in its next node. Note(node.next is not pointing to its next node but actually storing its address. ) And for the last element we are simply assigning None value because if we used node.next.data it will throw an error of NoneType element. Because next element is None. #linkedlist#computerscience#datastructure#datastructuresandalgorithms#dsa#code#programming#program#learncode#python#pythonprogramming#hustlecoder#hustle#photography#work#motivation#workspace#creativity#creative#grind#study See more Data Structures and Algorithms January 12 · Singly linkedlist using python.
