Live Demo  <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>This is document title</title> <style> h1 { color: #36CFFF; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Hello World!</h1> </body> </html> Applications of CSS As mentioned before, CSS is one of the most widely used style language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here: CSS saves time - You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want. Pages load faster - If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times. Easy maintenance - To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically. Superior styles to HTML - CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes. Multiple Device Compatibility - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing. Global web standards - Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So its a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.
