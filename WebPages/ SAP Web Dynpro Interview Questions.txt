As per my experience good interviewers hardly plan to ask any particular question during your interview, normally questions start with some basic concept of the subject and later they continue based on further discussion and what you answer ? What is Web Dynpro? Web Dynpro is standard SAP UI technology that allows you to develop web applications using graphical tools and development environment integrated with ABAP workbench. Using graphical tools reduce the implementation effort and you can better reuse and maintain components in ABAP workbench. How do you access Web Dynpro environment and graphical tools in ABAP work bench? To access Web Dynpro runtime environment and graphical tools in ABAP workbench, you can use Transaction code: SE80 What are the advantages of using Web Dynpro? These are key benefits of using Web Dynpro for developers in ABAP environment ? You can easily maintain and reuse components for development. Less implementation time as use of graphical tools. You can easily change layout and navigation using graphical tools. Easy structure changes. With use of data binding, you can use automatic data transport. Ease of integration in ABAP environment. Web Dynpro ABAP is same as Web Dynpro Java as support same set of functions for the application development. What is the use of MVC programming model? Web Dynpro applications are based on MVC model, whereas ? Model This allows the access to back end data in a Web Dynpro application. View This is used to ensure the representation of data in a web browser. Controller This is used to control communication between Model and view where it takes input from users and get the processes data from model and displays the data in browser. What is a View in Web Dynpro application? Each Web Dynpro application contains at least one view and it is used to define layout of a user interface. Each view consists of multiple user element and a controller and context. The controller is used to process user request and processing of data and context contains data to which elements of view are bound. What is the use of inbound and outbound plug-ins? You can navigate between different views using inbound and outbound plugs. The inbound and outbound plugs are part of view controller and inbound plug defines the starting point of view and outbound plug tells the subsequent view to be called. What is view set? A view set is defined as predefined section where you can embed different views in a Web Dynpro application. View set allows you to display more than one view in a screen. What are the advantages of using View set? Below are few advantages of view set in designing an application ? You can reuse views in a Web Dynpro window. You can easily make changes to layout at later stage. More structured approach to use more than one view. What is the use of Web Dynpro window? In Web Dynpro, window is used to use multiple views or view sets. A view can only be displayed when it is embed in a view and a window always contain one or more views which are connected by navigation links. Each window contains inbound and outbound plugs and they can be included in navigation chain. Inbound plugs within a window lead from the outbound plug of a view to the embedding window. Just like all other inbound plugs, they represent an event and thus call the event handler assigned to them. What is the use of Controller in Web Dynpro application? Controllers are used to define how a Dynpro application responds to user interactions. Each view has one controller which is responsible to perform actions as per user interaction. What is the use of mapping in Web Dynpro? In Dynpro application, you can define mapping between two global controller contexts or from view context to global controller context. Data binding of a UI element property is set up in the view layout. For this purpose, you use the Binding column in the properties table of the embedded UI elements. You click the button to open a dialog box which provides the context structure of the corresponding view for an element selection. How do you manage communication between different Controllers? You can create events to enable communication between controllers. You can allow one controller to trigger events in different controller. All events that you create in component controller they are available in component. To embed a view into another view, how you can do this? You can embed view in another view by using view container UI element. ViewContainerUIElement is an UI element to be used to hold the views in Web Dynpro application. What is global and local controller in Web Dynpro? In Global controller, the data declared in this can be accessed by all views and window in that component. View controller is a local controller for that view and canâ€™t be accessed by other controllers. What is a Faceless component? Faceless components in Web Dynpro doesnâ€™t contain any graphical components, no views or no windows. It only contains a component controller and you can add an additional custom controller. Why do we use faceless component? Faceless components are specifically used for receiving and structuring the data. Faceless components can be embedded to other components using component usage and you can supply the required data to these components. Why do we use version management in Web Dynpro application? You can use version management to manage older version of an object, compare versions or you can also reset them. Is it possible to call a Web Dynpro application from another Web Dynpro application? Yes, using method create_external_window How many component controllers can a Web Dynpro Component have? Component Controller is only one. You can create multiple controllers, but those are called Custom Controllers. How do you decide that a node is to be declared in the Component Controller or in the View Controller? If the node is going to be accessed in multiple views, it should be declared at the Component Controller level. However, If the node is absolutely specific to only one view, it can be defined in the View Controller. What is model class? A Model class is assistance class that contains business logic. How do you debug a web based Web Dynpro application? Using External breakpoints How do you navigate between views in Web Dynpro? Using inbound and outbound plugs Can you create multiple applications using a component in Web Dynpro? Yes for a component, you can create any number of applications. How do you call a Web Dynpro application? In a Web Dynpro application, component window has an inbound plug. This inbound plug can have parameters, which have to be specified as URL parameters. Default values that are overwritten by the URL parameters can be set in the application for these parameters. If neither a default value nor a URL parameter is specified, a runtime error is triggered. Which method can be used to access text symbols in assistance class? Using method _WD_COMPONENT_ASSISTANCE~GET_TEXT( ), this allows you to access text symbols of the assistance class in controller of your component. Which method can be used to set the break point for debugging purpose? It is suggested to set the breakpoint in method WDDOMODIFYVIEW under METHODS tab of Dynpro view. How do you manage information for end users in Web Dynpro application? In ABAP Workbench, you can also create and show messages that contain information for end users of Dynpro application. These messages are displayed on the screen. These are user interactive messages that displays important information about Web Dynpro application. How do you manage portal integration with Web Dynpro? You can also integrate an ABAP application into enterprise portal. You can also manage portal functions from a Web Dynpro application. You can call Web Dynpro code wizard to access portal manager methods. This can be used to perform the following functions ? Portal Events To navigate between Web Dynpro application within portal or portal content. Following navigation types are supported ? Object Based navigation Absolute navigation Relative navigation Work protect mode What is the use of interactive forms?
